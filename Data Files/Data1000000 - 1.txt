THE HISTORY OF CLARISSA HAELOWE. 



Had I not Mien into fresh trou- 
bles, nhich disabled me for several 
days from holdtngapen, lahould 
not have forborne enquiring after 
Tonrhealth.and that of your son; 
for I should have been but I«o 
ready to impute your silence to 
the cause, to which, to my very 

r'est concern, 1 find it was owing, 
jiwy to Heaven, my dear good 
fnend, to give you comfort in the 
way most desirable to yourself. 

1 am exceedingly concerned at 
Miss Howe's writing about me to 
my friends. 1 do assure you, that 
I was as ignorant of her intention 
50 to do, as of the contents of her 
J letter. Nor has she yet let me 

tw (discouraged , I suppose , by 
_ ill success) that she did write. 
It is impossible tosharethedelight 
^ich Bueh charming spirits give, 
Hhont the inconvenience that

Htwasbut yesterday thati wrote

is of that nature, which her un- 
ROiuibly eipressed lovo for me 



had made her take, an you wrote 
me word in your former. I was 
afraid that all Buch freedoms would 
be attributed to me. And I am 
sure, that nothing but my own ap- 
plication to my friends, and it full 
conviction of my contrition, will 
procure me favour. Least of nil 
canlexpect, that eitheryournie- 
diationorher8(botbof whosefond 
and partial love of me is ho well 
known) will avail me.

a,^eiitr 'jf^p^rptiofi,' than for an

• N6r let it be imagined, my dear 
and ever venerable friend, that 
my present turn of mind proceeds 
from gloominess or melancholy :for 
although it was brought on by dis- 
appointment (the world shewing 
me early , even at my first rushing 
into it, its true and ugly face ;) yei 
I hope, that it has obtained a better 
root, and will every day more and 
more, by its fruits, demonstrate to 
me , and to all my friends , that it 
has. 

Ihave written to my sister. Last 
Friday I wrote. So the dye is 
thrown. I hope for a gentle an- 
swer. But, perhaps, they will not 
vouchsafe me any. It is my first 
direct application, you know. 1 
wish Miss Howe had left me to my 
own workings in this tender point. 

It will be a great satisfaction to 
me to hear of your perfect re- 
covery, and that my foster- brother 
is out of danger. But why, said I, 
out of danger? — When can this be 
justly said of creatures , who hold 
y so uncertain a tenure ? This is 
one of those forms of common 
speech , that proves the frailty and 
the presumption of poor mortals, 
at the same time. 

Don't be uneasy you cannot 
answer your wishes to be with 
me. I am happier than I could 
have expected to be among mere 
strangers. It was grievous at 
first; but use reconciles every 
thing to UB. The people of the

who lodges in it [have I not said so 
formerly?] a good woman; who is 
the better for having been a profi- 
cient in the school of affliction. 

An excellent school! my dear 
Mrs. Norton, in which we are 
taught to know ourselves, to be 
able to compassionate and bear 
with one another, and to look up 
to a better hope. 

I have as humane a physician 
(whose fees are his least regard) 
and as worthy an apothecary , as 
ever patient was visited by. My 
nurse is diligent , obliging , silent, 
and sober. So I am not unhappy 
without: and within — 1 hope, my 
dear Mrs. Norton, that I shall bie 
every day more and more happy 
within. 

No doubt, it would be one of 
the greatest comforts I could 
know , to have you with me : you, 
who love me so dearly: who have 
been the watchful sustainer of my 
helpless infancy; you, by whose 
precepts I have been so much be- 
nefited! — In your dear bosom 
could I repose all my griefs: and 
by your piety and experience in 
the ways of Heaven , should I be 
strengthened in what I am still to 
go through. 

But, as it must not be, I will ac- 

?[uie8ce; and so, I hope, will you: 
or you see in what respects I am 
not unhappy; and in those that I 
am , they lie not in your power to 
remedy. 

Then, as I have told you, Ihave

friends! Both primarily (if they

for the evila they are put upon by

that he who can ait down preme-

eontent himself with abai excuse: 
.■ud yet, what fools must he sup-

he imagines them aa easy to be 
imposed upon, as he can impose 
ipon himself? 
In vain dost thou impute to 
ride or wilfulness the neceaaitj 
) which thou hast reduced this 
lady of parting with her clothes; 
hr can she do otherwise, and be 
!lhe noble-minded creature she is? 
Her implacable friends have re- 
foeed her the current cash she lefl 
behind her; and wished, aa her 
inster wrote to her, toaeeherre- 
duced to want: probably there- 
fore they will not be aorry that she

Miss Harlowe is tonly of opinion, 
that she shall never want nor weix

Oar friendships and intimacies, 
Lovelace, are only calculated for 
strong life and health. When 
sickness comes, we look round us, 
and upon one another, like 
frighted birds, at the sight of a 
kite ready to aouse upon them.

Try, Lovelace, if thou canst

words are swallowed up I 

For the arrows of the Almighty are

And I am full oftossings to and fro, 
unto the dawning of the day.

in soul f

than for hid treasures? 

Why is light given to one whose 
way is hid; and whom God hath

I was not in safety; neither had I 
rest; neither was I quiet: yet trouble 
came. 

But behold God is mighty, and 
despiseth not any. 

He giveth right to the poor — And 
if they be bound in fetters, andholden 
in cords of affliction, then he sheweth 
them their works and their trans- 
gressions. — 

I have a little leisure, and am in 
a scribbling vein: indulge me, 
Lovelace, a few reflections on 
these sacred books. 

We are taughtto read the Bible, 
when children , and as a rudiment 
only; and as far as I know, this 
may be the reason , why we think 
ourselves above it, when at a 
maturer age. For you know, that 
our parents , as well as we , wisely 
rate our proficiency by the books 
we are advanced to , and not by 
our imderstanding of those we 
have passed through. But, in my 
nucleus illness,! had the curiosity, 
in some of my dull hours (lighting 
upon one in his closet) to dip into 
it: and then I found, wherever I 
turned , that there were admirable 
things in it. I have borrowed one, 
on receiving from Mrs. Lovick the 
above meditation; for I had a 
mind to compare the passages con- 
tained in it by the book, hardly 
believing they could be so exceed- 
ingly apposite as I find they are. 
And one time or other, it is very 
likely, that I shall make a resolu- 
tion to give the whole Bible a 
perusal, by way of course^ as I may 
say. 

This , meantime , I will venture 



B»T( 



to repeat, is uertaiu.tlmt the style 

ia that truly easj, simple, and 
natural oue , which we ahould ad- 
mire in other authors etcesaivply. 
Then all the world join in an opi- 
nion of the antiquity, and authen- 
ticity too, of the book; and the 
leartied. are fond of strengthening 
their different arguments by its 
sanetiona. Indeed, I was eo much

in my head: but, perhaps, an- 
more obliged for it to Josepliua.

Oddenongh, with all onr pride 
of leaniing, that we choose to 
derive the little we know from the 
under cuirenls, perhaps muddy 
ones too, when the clear, the 
pelhieid fountain head, is much 
nearer at hand, and easier to be

mitted of my visit. I saw a visible 
alteration in her countenance for 
the worse; and Mrs. Lovick re- 
spectfully accusingheroftoo great 
assiduity to her pen, early and 
late, and ofherabatiaeuce the day 
before, I took notice of the altera- 
tion; and told her, that her phy- 
sician had greater hopes of her 
than she had of herself; and I 
would take the liberty to Bay,th8t 
despair of recovery allowed not 
room for cure. 

She said, she ueithei despaired.

tives for your pleas in his favour,

advised her to the air, and blamed 
her for BO greut an application, as 
he was told she made to her pen; 
and he gave it as the doctor's 
opinion, as well as his own, that 
Blie would recover, if she herself 
desired to recover , and would use 
the means. 

ShemaypoBsihIy write too mneh 
for her health: but I have ob- 
served, oa several occaaions, that 
when the medical men are ata loss 
what to prescribe, they enquire 
what their patients best like, or 
are moat diverted with, and forbid 
them that. 

But, noble-minded as they see 
this lady is, they know not half 
her nobleness of mind nor how 
deeply she is wounded; and de- 
pend too much upon her youlh, 
which I donbt will not do in this 
ease; and upon lime, which will 
not alleviate the woes of such a 
mind: for, having been bent upon

other views in living, than the 
common ones of eating, sleeping, 
dressing, visiting, and those other 
fashionable amusements , which 
fill up the time of most of her sex, 
especially of those of it, who think 
themselves fitted to shine in and 
adorn polite assemblies. Her erief , 
in short, seems to me to be oisuch 
a nature, that iime^ which alleviates 
most other persons* afflictions, 
will, as the poet says, give encrease 
to hers. 

Thou, Lovelace, mightest have 
seen all this superior excellence, 
as thou wentest along. In every 
word, in every sentiment, in every 
action is it visible. — But thy 
cursed inventions and intriguing 
spirit ran away with thee. 'Tis 
fit that the subject of thy wicked 
boast, and thy reflections on ta- 
lents so egregiously misapplied, 
should be thy punishment and thy 
curse. 

Mr. Goddard took his leave; 
and I was going to do so too, when 
the maid came up , and told her, 
a gentleman was below, who very 
earnestly enquired after her 
health, and desired to see her: his 
name Hickman. 

She was overjoyed; and bid 
the maid desire the gentleman to 
walk up. 

I would have withdrawn; but 
I suppose she thought it was 
likely I should have met him 
upon the stairs; and so she for- 
bid it. 

She shot to the stairs-head to 
receive him, and, taking his hand, 
asked half a dozen questions (with- 
out waiting for any answer) in re- 



lation to Miss Howe*s health; 
acknowledging, in high terms, her 

foodness in sending him to see 
er, before she set out upon her 
little journey. 

He gave her a letter from that 
voung lady which she put into her 
bosom , saying , she would read it 
by-and-by. 

He was visibly shocked to see 
how ill she looked. 

You look at me with concern, 
Mr. Hickman, said she — O sir! 
times are strangely altered with 
me, since I saw you last at my 
dear Miss Howe's! — What a 
cheerful creature was I then! — 
my heart at rest! my prospects 
charming! and beloved by every 
body ! — but I will not pain you ! 

Indeed, madam, said he, I am 
grieved for you at my soul. 

He turned away his face , with 
visible grief in it. 

Her own eyes glistened : but she 
turned to each of us, presenting 
one to the other — him to me, as 
a gentleman truly deserving to be 
called so — me to him, as your 
friend , indeed [how was I at that 
instant, ashamed of myself!] but, 
nevertheless , as a man of humani- 
ty; detesting my friend's base- 
ness ; and desirous of doing her all 
manner of good offices. 

Mr. Hickman received my civi- 
lities with a coldness, which, how- 
ever, was rather to be expected on 
your account, than that it deserved 
exception on mine. And the ladv 
invited us both to breakfast with 
her in the morning; he being 
obliged to return the next day. 

I left them together , and called

Dor professions to Miss Howe; 
ad Mita Howe's opinion, that 
lUiying you was the only way 
pw left to repair her wrongs. 

Mr. Hickman, as I also gAther- 
9, had pressed her, in Miss Hoire's 
une, to let her, on her i-eturn 
ram the Isle of Wight, £nd her at 
.neighbouring farmhouse., where 
eat apartments would be made 
«ady to receive her. She asked 
WW long it would be before they 
xtomed? And he told her, it 
proposed to be no more tlutn ,

she said, she should then perhaps 
have time to consider of that kind 
proposal. 

He had tendered her money 
from Mis3 Howe; but could not 
induce her to take any. No won- 
der I was refused! she only said, 
that if she had occasion, she would 
be obliged to nobody but Miss

came in hefore hreakfaatwasover. 
At her desire he sat down with us. 
Mr. Hickman asked him, if he 
could give him any consolation in 
relation, to Miss Harlowo's re- 
covery, to carry down to a friend 
who loved her aa she loved her 
own life? 

The lady, said he , will do very 
well, if she will resolve upon it 
herself Indeed you wUI, madam. 
The doctor is entirely of this 
opinion; and has ordered nothing 
for you, hut weak Jellies and in- 
nocent cordials, lest you should 
starve yourself. And let me tell 
you, madam, that so much watch- 
ing, BO little nourishment, andso

hare no appetite. Nothing you 
call nourishing will stay on my 
stomach. J do what 1 can: and

cusable if I did not.

make physic unnecessary in your 
case. And that is , " go to rest at 
ten at ni^ht. Kise not till seven in 
the morning. Let your breakfast 
be water-grur.l , or milk pottage, 
or weak broths: your dinner any 
thin^ you like, so you will but eat : 
a disn of tea, with milk in the after- 
noon; and sago for your supper: 
and, my life for yours, this diet, 
and a month's country air, will set 
youup." 

We were much pleased with the 
worthy gentleman's disinterested 
regimen: and she said, referring 
to ner nurse (who vouched for her). 
Pray, Mr. Hickman, let Miss Howe 
know the good hands I am in; and 
as to the kind charge of the gen- 
tleman, assure her, that all I pro- 
mised to her, in the longest of my 
two last letters , on the subject of 
my health, I do and will, to the 
utmost of my power, observe. I 
have engaged, sir, (to Mr. God- 
dard) I have engaged, sir, (to me) 
to Miss Howe, to avoid all wilful 
neglects. It would be an un- 
pardonable fault , and very ill be- 
come the character I would be 
glad to deserve , or the temper of 
mind I wish my friends hereafter 
to think me mistress of, if I did 
not. 

Mr. Hickman and I went after- 
wards to a neighbouring coflFee- 
bouse; and he gave me some ac- 
count of your behaviour at the ball 
on Monday night, and of your 
treatment of him in the conference 
he had with you before that ; which 
he represented in a more favour- 
able light than you had done 
roiirseii: and jet he gave his sen- 



timents of you with great free- 
dom , but with the politeness of a 
gentleman. 

He told mehow very determined 
the lady was against marrying 
you; that she had, early this 
morning, set herself to write a 
letter to Miss Howe , in answer to 
one he brought her, which he was 
to call for at twelve , it being al- 
most finished before he saw her 
at breakfast; and that at three 
he proposed to set out on his re- 
turn. 

He told me that Miss Howe, and 
her mother and himself, were to 
begin their little journey for the 
Isle of Wight on Monday next: 
but that he must make the most 
favourable representation of Miss 
Harlowe's bad health, or they 
should have a very uneasy ab- 
sence. He expressed the pleasure 
he had in finding the lady in such 
good hands. He proposed to call 
on Dr. H. to take his opinion whe- 
ther it were likely she would re- 
cover ; and hoped he should find it 
favourable. 

As he was resolved to make the 
best of the matter, and as the lady 
had refused to accept of money 
offered by Mr. Hickman, I said 
nothing of her parting with her 
clothes. I thought it would serve 
no other end to mention it, but to 
shock Miss Howe: for it has such 
a sound with it, that a woman of 
her rank and fortune should be so 
reduced, that I cannot myself 
think of it with patience; nor 
know I but one man in the world 
who can.

raciseneases, which the confident,

imagine the world made for us, 
and for us only. 

Thus as to useful knowledge, 
while others go to the bottom, we 
only skim the surface; are de- 
spised by people of solid sense, of 
true honour, and superior talents; 
and shutting our eyes, move round 
and round (like so many blind 
mill-horses) in one narrow circle, 
while we imagine we have all the 
world to range in. 

* * * 

I threw myself in Mr. Hick- 
man's way, on his return irom the 
lady. 

He was excessively moved at 
taking leave of her ; being afraid, 
as he said to me (though he would 
not tell her so) that he should 
never see her again. She charged 
him to represent every thing to 
Miss Howe in the most favourable 
light that the truth would bear. 

He told me of a tender passage 
at parting; which was, that having 
saluted her at her closet- door, he 
could not help once more taking 
the same liberty, in a more fer- 
vent manner, at the stairs-head, 
whither she accompanied him; 
and this in the thought, that it 
was the last time he should ever 
have that honour; and offering to 
apologize for his freedom (for he 
had pressed her to his heart with 
a vehemence, that he could neither 
account for nor resist) — "Excuse 
you, Mr. Hickman! that I will: 
you are my brother and my friend : 
and to shew you, that the good 
man who is to be happy with my 
beloved Miss Howe, is very dear 
to me, yoM shall carry to her this 



token of my love" [offering her 
sweet face to his salute, and 
pressing his hand between hers] : 
*And perhaps her love of me will 
make it more agreeable to her, 
than her punctilio would other- 
wise allow it to be: and tell her, 
said she, dropping on one knee, 
with clasped hands, and uplifted 
eyes, that in this posture you see 
me, in the last moment of our 
parting, begging a blessing upon 
you both, and uiat you may be 
the delight and comfort of each 
other for many, very many happy 
years ! " 

Tears, said he, fell from my 
eyes : I even sobbed with mingled 
joy and sorrow: and she retreat- 
ing as soon as I raised her, I went 
down stairs highly dissatisfied 
with myself for going ; yet unable 
to stay; my eyes hxed the con- 
trary way to my feet, as long as I 
could behold the skirts of her rai- 
ment. 

I went into the back-shop, con- 
tinued the worthy man, and re- 
commended the angelic lady to 
the best care of Mrs. Smith; and, 
when I was in the street, cast my 
eye up at her window: there, for 
the last time, I doubt, said he, that 
I shall ever behold her, I saw her; 
and she waved her charming hand 
to me, and with such a look of 
smiling goodness, and mingled 
concern, as I cannot describe. 

Pr'ytheetellme, thou vile Love- 
lace, if thou hast not a notion, 
even from these jejune de- 
scriptions of mine, that there must 
be a more exalted pleasure in in- 
tellectual friendship, than ever

l^t^lied n^ay from us so soon, 



There must be still a great deal 
for you to do for the good of all 
who have the huppineas to know 
yon.

in which your situation is already

to the proposal Mr. Hickman has

too warm. Yet warmth in friend-

THE HISTORY OF 



But if you are displeased with ; 
me for the freedoms I took so long ' 
ago as you mention, I am afraid, I 
ifyou Knew what passed upon an 
application I made to your sister 
very lately (in hopes to procure 
you the absolution your heart is 
so much set upon) that you would 
be still more concerned. But they 
have been even with me — but I 
must not tell you all. I hope, 
however, that these unforgivers 
[my motherV among them] were 
always good, dutS'ul, passive 
children to their parents. 

Once more forgive me. I owned 
I was too warm. But I have no 
example to the contrary, but from 
you: and the treatment you meet 
with is very little encouragement 
to me to endeavour to imitate you 
in your dutiful meekness. 

You leave it to me to give a ne- 
gative to the hopes of the noble 
family, whose only disgrace is, 
that so very vile a man is so nearly 
related to them. But yet — alas ! 
my dear, I am so fearful of con- 
sequences, so selfishly fearful, if 
this negative must be given — I 
don't ^ow what I should say — 
but give me leave to suspend, 
however, this negative, till 1 hear 
from you again. 

This earnest courtship of you 
into their splendid family is so 
very honourable to you — they so 
justly admire you — you must 
have had such a noble triumph over 
the base man — He is so much 
in earnest — the world knows so 
much of the unhappy affair — you 
may do still so much good — your 
will is so inviolate — your rela- 



tions are so implacable — think 
dear, and re-think. 

And let me leave you to do so, 
while I give you the occasion of 
the flutter I mentioned at the be- 
ginning of this letter; in the con- 
clusion of which you will find tiie 
obligation I have consented td lAy 
myself under, to refer this impor- 
tant point once more to yV)ur dis- 
cussion, before I give in your 
name, the negative that cannot, 
when given, be with honour to 
yourself repented of or recalled. 

Know then, my dear, that I 
accompanied my mother to Co- 
lonel Ambrose's, on the occasion I 
mentioned to you in my former. 
Many ladies and gentlemen were 
there whom you know; parti- 
cularly Miss Kitty D'Oily, Miss 
Lloyd, Miss Biddy d'OUyffe, Miss 
Biddulph, and their respective 
admirers with the colonel's two 
nieces: fine women both; besides 
many whom you know nof^ for 
they were strangers to me but by 
name. A splendid company, and 
all pleased with one another, till 
Colonel Ambrose introduced one, 
who, the moment he was brought 
into the great hall, set the whole 
assembly into a kind of agita- 
tion. 

It was your villain. 

I thought I should have sunk as 
soon as 1 set my eyes upon him. 
My mother was also affected; and, 
coming to me, Nancy, whispered 
she, can you bear tiie sight of 
that wretch without too mucn emo- 
tion? — If not, withdraw into the 
next apartment. 

I could not remove. Every bo-

1 still kept my seat, and he 
either saw me not, or would not 
yet see me; and addressing him- 
self to my mother, taking her un- 
willing hand, with au air of high 
asBurauce, 1 am glad to see you 
here, madam, 1 hope MissHowe 
is well. I have reason to complain 

freatly of her: but hope to owe to 
er the highest obtigatiou thatcan 
be laid on man. 

My daughter, air, is accnstjimed 
to be too warm and too zealous in 
her friendships for either my tran- 
quillity, or her own. 

There had indeed been some 
late occasion given for mutual 
displeasure between my mother 
and me: but I think she might 
have spared this to iiin ; though 
nobody heard it I believe but the 
person to whom it was spoken, and 
the lady who told it me; for my 
mother spoke it low. 

We are not wholly, madam, to 
live for ourselves, said the vile 
hypocrite; itianot every one wl\'s 
has a soul capa-toVe o^ 'ineiv&^vi&-.

and what a. heart miiBt that be, 
■which can, be insensible to the in-

This senllment from Mi. Love-

no end, Hurely, in eudeavouring 
to make me think , as well of you 
as some innocent creatures l^ve 
thought ofrou, totheircoEt. 

She would have flung from him. 
But, detaining her hand — Leas 
severe, dear madam, said he, be 
less severe in f/us place, I beseech 
you. You will allow, that a very 
faulty person may see his errors; 
and when he does, and owns them, 
and repents, should he not be 
treated mercifully? 

Your air, sir, seems not to be 
that of a penitent. But the place 
may as properly excuse this sub- 
ject, as what you call my se- 
verity. 

But dearest madam, permit me 
to »ay , that I hope for your inter- 
est with your charming daughter

it put in my power to convince all 
the world, tliat there never was a 
truer penitent. And why, why

I was going out of the assembly 
in great diaorder. " 

How kind this is,8aid thevrretch 
and, ready to follow me, opened 
the door for me. 

I turned back upon this; and 
notknowing what Idtd, snapped 
my fan just in his face, aa be 
turned short upon me; and the 
powder flew from bis hair. 

Every body seemed as much 
pleased, aa I was vexed. 

He turned to Mr. Hickman, 



n; Mr. Hickman, you will be 
one of the happiest men in the 
world, because you are a good 
man, and will do nothing to pro- 
voke thia passionate lady; and 
because she has too much good 
sense to be provoked without rea- 
son : but else the lord have mercy 
upon you! 

This man, this Mr. Hickman, 
my deaij is too meek far a man. 



Indeed he is. — But my patient 
mother twits me, that her 
sionate daughter ought to 
him Ihe belfer for that. But me«k 
men abroad ore not always meek 
men at home. I have observed 
that in more instances than 
and if they tceie, I should not, I 
verily think, like them the better 
for being so. 

He then turned to mr mot 
resolved to be even with her . _ . 
Where, good madam, could Mies 
Howe get all this spirit? 

Tbe company around smiled, 
for I need not t£ll you , that my 
mother'shighspiritednessis prett

said, Sir, yon treat me, as you do 
the rest ot the world — but — 

I beg pardon, madam, inter*

tiring to the other end of the hall) 
be turned to MissPlayford; What

I have no patience with such a

Bee me ebnn him )u I did) that the 
poet's observation waa too true, 
that the generality' of ladies were 
- ' B in Ihar Jiearls , or they could 
be so much taken with a man 
who had 90 DotoriouE a, character. 

I told him, the reflection both of 
the poet and applier waa mnch 
too general , and made with more 
ill-aatare than good manners. 

When the wretch saw bow in- 
dustriously I avoided hira (ahift- 
ing from one part of the hall to 
another) he atlast boldly Btept up 
to me.asmymotherandMr.Uick- 
man were taUdng to me; and thus 
before them accosted me : 

I beg your pardon, madam; but 
by your motner's leave, I must 
Jiave a few moments' conversation 
with you, either here, or at your 
own house; and I beg you will 
give me the opportunity. 

Nancy, said my mother, hear 
what he has to say to" you. In 
nypreaence youmay: and better 
n the adjoining apartment', if '' 
must be. than to come to you 

1 retired to one comer of the 
ball, my mother following me, and 
be, tating Mr. Hickman under 
the arm. Following her — Well, 

ir, said I, what have you to aay? 

- Tell me heie. 
I have been telling Mr. Hick- 

aaii, said he, how much I am con- ' 
cemed for the injuries Ihave done 
to the most excellent woman in 
the world: and yet, that she ob~ 
tained such a glorious triumph 
over me the last time I had the 
honour to see her, aa, with my 
peaitence, ought to have abated 



t: 



her former resentments : but that 
1 will , with all my sonl , en ter into 
to obtain her for- 
giveoesa of me. My cousins Mon- 
tague have told you this. Lady 
Betty and Lady Sarah, and my 

are engaged for 
hononr. I know your power 

dear creature. My couains 

me, you gave them hopes you 

would use it ia my behalf. My 

Lord M. and his two sisters, are 

of it 

her before now: I hope yoi . _. 

And will you be so goodaa to tell 

if I may have any hopes? 

■I must speak on this subject, 

me tell you, that you have 

broken her heart. Youknownot 

the value of the lady you havein- 

jured. You deserve her not. And 

she despises you, as she ought. 

DeacMisBliowe,minglenotpa8- 

jn with denunciations so severe^ 
I must know my fate. I will go 
, if I find her ab- 
solutely irreconcileable. But I 
hope she will give me leave to at- 
tend upon her, to know my doom 
from her own mouth. 

It would be death immediate for 
her to see you. And what must 
yo\i be , to be able to look her ia 
the face? 

1 then reproached him (with 
vehemence enough you may be- 
lieve] on his baaeueas, and the 
evila he bad made you suffer: the 
distress he had reduced you to ^all 
your friends made your enemies: 
the vile house he had carried you 
to: hinted at his villainous arts; 
the dreadful arrest: and told Mm 



hAvehira. 

He vindicated not any p!irt of 
hHCOiidact,but that of'theitrrest; 
and M) Botemnly protested hU eor- 
lotr forhia usage of you, accusiog 
himself in the freest manner , and 
by deserved appellations, that I 
promieed to lay before you this 
part of our conrerefLtion, And 
nawyoDhaveit. 

My mother, as well aa Mr. Hick- 
man, believes, from what passed 
•D this occasion, that he istoucbed 
in oonscience for the wrongs he 
Ins done you: but, by his whole 
behaviour, I must own, it seems to 
EU tiiat nothing caa touch him 
fa half an hour together. Yet I 
bftieno doubt, that he would wil- 
Hp^y manv yon: and it piijues 
hia pride, I conld see, that he 
■faoild be denied; as it did mine, 
that Huch a wretcli had dared to 
(hint it in hia poiver ta have Bucb 
ft ngmaa whenever he pleased; 
i that it must be accounted a 
soenston, and matter of obli- 
1 (by all his own family at 
4 that he would vouchsafe to 
i& of marriage. 
F-Sov, my dear, you have before 
- " ■easori why 1 suspend the 
neeative to the ladies of 
bfanily. My mother, Miss Lloyd, 
id llise BJddulph , who were in- 
Kjtitive after the subject of our

Mity I thought it was right, in 

■ome degree, to gratify (especially 
as tiioie young ladies are of oar 
Klect acquaintance), are all of 
I apinion that you should be hie. 



HARLOWE. 23 

Vou will let Mr. Hickman koow 
your whole mind; and when he 
acquaints me with it, 1 will tell 
yon all my own.

will bring me of the state of your 
health, be favourable ! prays, with 
the utmost fervency.

LETTER Vn. 



Aftbr I have thankfiiily ac- 
knowledged your fevour in send- 
ing Mr. Hickman to visit me 
before yon .set out upon your in- 
tended journey, Imust chide y( 



it is if it would not admit of that 
cementing freedom) for suspending 
the decisive negative, which, upon 
sueh full dehberatioa, I had en- 
treated yon to give to Mr. Love- 
lace's relations. 

I am sorry that I am obliged to 
repeat to you, my dear, whoKnow 
me BO well, that, were I sure 1 
should live many years, I would 
not have Mr. Lovelace ; much less 
can I think of him, as it is pro- 



fame, yetlnever thought it right 
to give more than a secuiul place 
to the world's opinion. T;\s.c ti«X- 
lengesmade to Mi-^^-^^a-eai^t - 



my reputation: and what ail- 
vantage would it be to me, were il 
retrieTable, and were I to live 
long, if Icould not acquit myself 
to Msedf* 

Ilaving in mj former said eo 
much on the ficedoma you have 
taken with nij friends , 1 shall say 
the less now; but i/our hint, tbat 
Honiething else has newly passed 
between some of tbem and you, 
givea me great concern, and that 
well for my own sake, as for 
!rs; since it must necessarily in - 
. . we tliem against me. 1 wish, 
my dear, tbat I had been left to 

very interesting to myself. But 
since what is done cttnnot be 
helped, I mnat abide the conae- 

Juences: yet I dread, more Ikon 
p.fare, what may bo my sister's 
answer, if an answer will be at all 
vouchsafed. 

Will yoa give me leave, my 
dear, to close this sabject with one 
remark? — Itisthis; thatmy be- 
loved friend, in points where ber 
own laudable zeal la concerned, 
: bsa ever seemed more ready to fly 
from the rebuke, than irom the 
fault. If you will eicnse this free- 
dom , I will acknowledge thus far 
in favour of your way of thinking ; 
as to the conduct of some parents 
in these nice cases, th&tindiscreel 
opposition does frequently as 
muchmischief as^iVW^love. 

As to the invitation you a-tb so 
kind as to give me, to remove 

■ 'ately into your neighbour- 
-^ J hare told Mr. J^ckman 



tbat 1 will cousider of it; but be- 
lieve , if you will be so good as ta 
excuse me, that [ shall not accept ' 
of it, even should I be able to ri 
move. I will give you my reaaoi 
for declining it ; and so 1 oughts . 
when both my love and my grati- ' 
tude, would make a visit now-and' 
then from mv dear Miss Howe tbe 
most consolatory thing i 
world to me. 

You must know then, thatthis 
greattown, wickedasitis, wants 
□ot opportunities of being better; 
having daily prayers at several 
churches in it ; and 1 am desirous^ 
as my strength will permit, to eiii>5 
brace those opportuwitioB. Tte, 
method 1 have proposed to myself^ 
(and was beginnmg to practae 
when that cruel arrest deprived 
me both of Jreedom and streu^h) 
is this: wben I was disposeuto 
gentle exercise , 1 took a chai: tO' 
St. Duustan's church in Fleet- 
Street, where are prayers at se 



take chair) to Lincoln' 
chapel, where at eleven i 
morning, and at five in the sfter-' 
noon, are the same desirable op-.- 
portunit.ies ; and at other tiixefl to 
go no further than Covent Gudea : 
church, where are early mcming-i 
pr^ era likewise. 

This method pursued, I loobti 
not, will greatly help, as it hu al- 
ready done, to calm my distarbecl'i 
thoughts, and to bring met) tliab 
perfect resignatiou after which I- 
aspire: for Imust own, mydea^. 
tbat sometimes still my erieri and 
my reflections are l«o heaty ft 



■me; and all tlie aid I can draw 
from religimis iliUks ia hardly auffi- 
cient to support loy staggering 
leason. I am avery young crea- 
ture, jon know, my dear, to be 
left to my own conduct in such 
(UrcumBtaucca as I am in. 

Another reason why I choose 
not to go down into j 
bourhood , is , the displ 
might arise , on my ai 
tween your molher and you. 

Ifindeedyouwereactually 
lied, and the worthy man (who 
wonld then have a title to all your 
r^ard] were earnestly desirons 
of my near ncighhourhood , 1 
know not what I might do: for 
although I might not perhaps in- 
tend to give up my other impor- 
tant reasona at the Ihne I should 
make yon a congratulatory visit, 
— ' ■ might not know how to deny 
llf the pleasure of continning 
you when there. 

I send you Inclosed the copy of 
t^ letter to mj sister. I hope it 
mil be thoi^ht to he written with 
a true penitent spirit; for indeed 
it is. 1 desire that you will nol 
think 1 Btoop too low in it; aince 
there can be no such thing as thai 
in acbild toparentawhomshehas 
nnbappily offended. 

But if still (perhaps more dis~ 
eosted than before at your free- 
aom with them) they should pase 
it by with the coutempt of silence 
(fori have not yet been favoured 
with an answer) I must lean ' 
think it right in them to do 
•apeeiatly as It is my first direct 
application : for I have often can-

But if my letter should be an-

will make me loth to communicate 
it to so warm a friend — you must 
not, my dear, take upon you to 
censure my relations; but allow , 
for them, aa they know not what I 
have suffered; as being filled with 
j'ltrt resentments against me fjiw' 
to them, if they MiVit them just;) 
and as not being able to judge of 
the reality of my penitence. 

And after all, what can they do 
for me? — Tbey_ can only pily 
me: and what will that do, out 
augment their own 'jn'ef'; to wiuch 
at present their reseutinent is an 
alleviation? For can they by their 
pity restore to me my lost reputa-

But indeed his threatening to

I never, never more, shall see him 
in this world. 

Since you are so loth, my dear, 
to send the desired negative to the 
ladies of his family, 1 will only 
trouble you to transmit the letter 
I shall inclose for that purpose; 
directed indeed to yourself, be- 
cause it was to you that those 
ladies applied themselves on this 
occasion; but to be sent by you 
to any one of the ladie&, at your 
own choice. 

I commend myself, my dearest 
Miss Howe, to your prayers ; and 
conclude with repeated thanks for 
sending Mr. Hickman to me; and 
with wishes for your health and 
happiness, and for the speedy ce- 
lebration of your nuptials ; 
Your ever affectionate and 
obliged , 

Clabissa Harlowe. 

LETTER Vin. 

Miss Clarissa Harlowe to Miss Howe. 

[Inclosed in the preceding.] 

Thursday, July 27. 

MT DBABEST MISS HOWB, 

Since you seem loth to acquiesce 
in my determined resolution, signi- 
fied to you as soon as I was able 
to hold a pen, I beg the favour of 
J^oa^ bjtma, or bj any other way 



you think most proper, to acquaint 
the worthy ladies who have ap- 
plied to you in behalf of their re- 
lation, that, although I am in- 
finitely obliged to their generous 
opinion of me, yet I cannot con- 
sent to sanctify^ as I may say, Mr. 
Lovelace's repeated breaches of 
all moral sanctions, and hazard 
mjr future happiness by an union 
with a man, through whose pre- 
meditated injuries, m a long train 
of the basest contrivances, 1 have 
forfeited my temporal hopes. 

He himself, when he reflects 
upon his own actions, must surely 
bear testimony to the justice, as 
well as fitness of my determina- 
tion. The ladies, I dare say, 
would, were they to know the 
whole of my unhappy story. 

Be pleased to acquaint them, 
that I deceive myself, if my reso- 
lution on this head (however un- 
gratefully, and even inhumanly, 
he has treated me) be not owing 
more to principle than passion. 
Nor can I give a stronger proof of 
the truth of this assurance, than 
by declaring that I can and wUL 
forgive him, on this one easy con- 
dition, that Tie will never molest me 
more. 

In whatever way you choose to 
make this declaration, be pleased 
to let my most respectful compli- 
ments to the ladies of that noole 
family, and to my LordM. accom- 

gany it. And do you, my dear, 
elieve that I shall be, to the last 
moment of my life. 

Your ever obliged and 
aflectionate , 

Clarissa hablowe.

three letters of thine to 
tftke notice of,* but am divided in 
017 mind, whether to quarrel nith 
thee, on thy unmercifal re- 
flections, or to thank thee for thy 
acceptable particularity and di- 
ligeoee. Bnt several of my aweot 
dears have I, indeed, inmyti"" 
made to cry and laugh ii 
breatb; nay one side of their 
pretW faces laugh, before the ery 
could go off the other: why may 1 
not, therefore, curae and applaud 
thae in the same moment? So take 
both in one : and what follows, 
it shall rise from my pen. 

Hoif often httve I ingenuously 
confessed my sins against this ex- 
cellent creature? — Yet thou 
never sparest me, although as bad 
ft ntaa as myself. Since then I 
eet so little b^ tny confessions, I 
have a good mind to try to defend 
myself; and that not only from 
ancient and modern story, but 
from common practice; and yet 
avoid repeating any thing 1 have 
■ngeestnl before on my 

1 am in a humour to play the 
fool with my p«n: briefly than, 
from ancient story first: — dost 
Ihou not think, thut I am us much 
entitled to forgiveneaa of Mia 
Hariowe's account, as Virgil' 

Ibero was on Queen Dido's 1 Fo 
l^at an ungrateful varlet was 
■tat vagabond to the hoipilahle 
fanceu who had mllingiy ---

ferred upon him the last favour? 
Stealing away (whence, I sup- 
se the ironical phrase of Tn/s^j 
_ "jun to this day) like a thief — 
prelendedly indeed at tie eom- 
moiid of the gods-, but could 
that be, when the errand he went 
upon was to rob other princes, not 
onl^ of tbeir dominions, bnt of 
their lives? — Yet this fellow is, 
at every word , the pitis ^neas 
with the immortal bard who cele- 
brates him. 

Should Miss Harlowe even 
break her heart (which Heaven 
focbidi) for the usage she has re- 
ceived (to say nothing of her dis- 
appointed pride, to which her 
death would be attributable, more 



And have 1 half the obligation to 
her that iEneaa had to the Queen 
of Carthage? The latter placing 
a confidence, the former none, in 
her man?— Then, whom W.'e have 
I robbed? Whom ehe have I in- 
jured? Her brother's worthless \ 
life I gave him, instead of taking 
any man's; while the Trojan va- 
gabond destroyed his thousands. J 
Why then should it not be the 
pioiis Lovelace, as well as ihepi'is 
.^neaa? For, dost thou think, 
had a conHagratiou happened, 
and had it beeo iu my power, that 
I would not have saved my old 
Ancbises (as he did his from the 
Ilion bonfire) even at the expense 
of my Creiisa, had I had a wife 
of that name? 

But fbr a more modern instance 
in my favour — lia,\e V MaB.4'^\a^

THE msTonv OF 



Queen, as she was called, uaed 
one of her own blood, a aister- 
queen; who threw heraelf into her 
protection from her rebel sub- 
jects ; and whom she detained pri- 
soner eighteen yeara, and at last 
Cttt off her head? Yet do not 
honest Proteatanta pronounce her 
pious too?— And call her particn- 
larlyfiaiV queen? 

As to cummrm practice — who, 
let me ask, that has it in his power 
to gratify a prEtdominftnt passion, 
be it what it will, denies himself 
the gi'atification ? — Leaving it t« 
cooler deliberation (and, if he be 
a great man, to bis flatterers) to 
findareasonfor it afterwards? 

Then, as to the worst part of my 
treatment of this lady ^- bow 
many men are there, who, as well 
aa 1, have sought, by intoxicating 
liquors, first to inehriate, then to 
Bubdue? What signifies what the 
polalians were, when the 

Letme tell thee, upon the whole, 
that neither the Queen of Car- 
■'lage, nor the Queen of Scots, 
omd have thought they had any 
'aBontocomplaiuof cruelty,had 
they been used no worse than I 
have used the queen of my heart ; 
and then do I not aspire with my 
whole soul to repair by marriage? 
K Would the^fW j£neas, thinkeat 
^L tiiou, have done such a piece of 
^1 jnstice by Dido, had she lived?

to do with the world? 

And now I sit me peaceably 
down to consider thy letters. 

I hope thy pleas in my favonr,* 
when she gave tbee(so generously 
gave thee) for me, my letters, 
were urged with an honest energy. 
But I suspect thee much for bang 
too ready to give up thy client. ' 
Then thou hast such a misgiving 
aspect; an aspect, rather inviting 
rejection, than currying persua- 
sion with it; and art such an he- 
sitating, such an humming and 
hawing caitiHF, that I shall attri- 
bute my failure, if I do fail, ratber 
to the inability and ill looks of mf 
advocate, than to my canse. 
Again, thou art deprived of tbs< 
force men of our cast give toargn- 
mentsl for she won't let toed' 
Kwear! — Art moreover a very 
heavy thoughtless fellow; toler- 
able only at a second rebound; a 
horrid dunce at the imprumplu. 
These, encountering wiui sucb a 
lady, are great die ao vantages. — 
Andstill agreater is thy balancing 
(as thou dost at present) between 
old rakery and new reformation;- 
since this puta thee into the saioo" 
situation with her, as they toldine| 
at Leipeic Martin Luther was in,, 
at the first public dispute whichr 
he held, in defence of his suppoae4.^

esttiioujiot, that those words (so

heard ono of the former very vehe-

and child, were convinced to the 
contrary by his howling. 

I cantellthee, that, if nothing

to set both love and me at defiance. 
Thoucanst not imagine howmuch 
I envy (See, and betYloclor, aiidher

Wherefore, if nothing else will 
do, I will see her. I'll tell thee of 
an admirable etpcdient, just come

and I was thought to make a fine 
sleek appearance; my broad rose-

and I was much admired upon the

_ iBsest for the books of scripture, 
thou art certainly right in it. But 
'iia Htrange to me , that thoa wert

renc« them : and how was it poa- 

ile that thou couldest not, for

I'll tell thee a short story, whieh 
I had from my tutor, admonishing 
me against exposing myself by 
^noronlwon(ie;-,when^ should quit 
college, to go to town, or travel. 

" The first time Drydeii's Alex- 
ftodar's Feast fell into his hands, 
he told me, he was prodisiously 
charmed with it; and, having 
never heard any body speak of it 
before, thought, as thou doEt of 
the Bible, that he had made a new 
disoorery. 

"He haatened to an appolnt- 
meitt which he bad with several 
wita (for he was then in town) one 
of whom was a noted critic , who, 
according to him, had more merit 
thiiD good fortune; for all the lit- 
tle nibblers in wit, whose writings 
would not stand the test of 
criticiam, made it, he said, a com- 
mon cause to rmi him down, as men 
would a mad dog. 

"The young gentleman (for 
young he then was) set forth mag- 
nificently ID the praises of that 
inimitable performance; andgave 
himself ^s of lecnndhand merit, 
for finding out its beauties.

you lived till now, or with what 
sort of company have you con- 
versed, young as you are, that 
you have never beforeheard of the

This story had such an effect 
upon me, who had ever a proud 
heart, and wanted to be thought a 
clever fellow, that, in order to 
avoid the like disgrace, I laid 
down two rules to myself. The 
first, whenever I went into com- 
pany where there were strangei-s, 
to hear every one of them speak, 
before I gave myself liberty to 
prate: theother,if Ifoundany of 
them above my match, to give up 
all title to new discoveries, con- 
tenting myself to praise whatthey 
praised, as beauties familiar to 
me, though I had never heard of 
them before. And so, by degrees, 
I got Ibe reputation of a wit my- 
self: aod when I threw off all 
restraint, and books, and learned 
conversation, and fell in with some 
of our brethren who are now 
wandering in Erebus, and with 
such others as Helton, Mowbray, 
'i'ourville, and thyself, I set up on 
my own stock; and like what we 
have been told of Sir Kichard , in 
his latter days, valued myself on 
beingtheEmperoroftbecompauy: 
for, having fathomed the depth of 
them all, and afraid of no rival but 
thee, whom also I had got a little

in the way to be a mamma.

the ill effects the terrormightht

It concerns me, however, not a

There never, surely, mas such nil

keep her own secret, when the 
revealing of it could answer no 
possible good end ; and when she 
wants not (one would think) to 
raise to herself either pity or 
friends, or to me enemies, by the

not all her own aex laugh in their

suade her Iriend to make up all 
matters by matrimony ; which, no 
doubt, is the beat, nay, the only 
method she can take, for her own 
honour, and that of her family. 

I had once thought of revenging 
myself on that vLxeu; and, parti- 
cularly, aa thou may'at** re-

to this purpose on the journey she 
is going to take, which had been

I be old penitent fornicator , a

What figures would a couple of 
brocaded or laced -waist coated 
toupets make with their sour 
screwed up half-cocked faces, and 
more than half-shut eyes, in a

their respective rogueries? This 
scheme, were we only to make 
trial of it, and return afterwards 
to our old ways, might serve to 
better purpose by far, than Hor- 
ner's in the Country Wife, to bring 
the pretty girls to ub.

Friday night, July 18, 

I WILL now, my dearest fnemdi 
write to you all mj mind , withow 
reserve, on your resolution not tr™ 
have this vilest of men. Yougwi^ 
me, in yours of Sunday the 23l^ 
reasons so worthy of the pun 
mind of my Clariasa, in support 
of this your reaolntion. that no-^ 
thing hut self-love, lest 1 sbouli 
lose my ever- ami able friend, coali 
have prevailed npon me to wtidi 
you to alter it. Indeed , I thought 
it was impossible there could 0$ 
(however Qesirable)ao noble I 
stance given by any of our se , 
a passion conciuercd, when tnera 
were so many mducementa to give 
way to it And therefore I wa» 
willing to urge you once mt 
_ jij^j, j^gj indignation. 



^^Vnd to be prQvaJled upon bj the 
^"wUeitations of /lis frieuds, before 
yoo carried jour reaentinenta to 
M great a height, that it would 
be more difficult for you , and less 
toyoor honour, to comply, than 
if you had compbed at firsL 

But now, my dear, that I 

you fixed in your noble resolution: 

and that it ta impoiiaible for your 

^^•nre mind to join Itaelf with that 

^■WM) perjured a miscreant; I 

^^Kfatalate yon most heartily npoii 

^HRl and beg your pardon for but 

^VieeiDingtodoubt, thatrtmrjand 

* practice were not the same thing 

irith my beloved Clariaaa. 

I have only one thing that sad 
deaa my heart on this occasion; 
and that ie the bad state of bealtli 
Mr. Hickman (unwillingly) owns 
you are in. Hitherto you have 
well observed the doctrine yon al- 
ways laid down to me. That a 
oeoBOred person should first seek 
toibejuatified to/iicsei/', andgive 
but « 4Bcond place to the world's 

X' lion of her; and, ia all cases 
re the two could not be recon- 
ciled, have preferred the first to

wall joatlfied to your own heart as 
well as to your Anna Howe. Let 
ma therefore bosoecit you to en- 
deavoart by all poasiole means, 
to veeover your health and spirits: 
K and this, as what, if it emt be 
L ffltected , will crowu the work, 
k wul shew the world, that you were 
K indeed got above the base wretch ;

well by yont ciample , as by your 
precepts. 

For heaven's sake, then, for 
the world's sake, for tho honour 
ofoursex, and form^ sake, ouce 
more 1 beseech you, try to over- 
come this shock: and if you can 
overcome it, 1 shall then be as 
happy as 1 wish to be ; for 1 can- 
not, indeed 1 cannot, think of 
parting with you, for many, many 

The reasons you give for dis- 
couraging my wishes to have you 
that 



mind is fully settled , as (nc 
are so abaolutely dotermiued Ju it, 
witii regard to this wretch) 1 hope 
it will soon be, I shall expect yon 
with us, or near ua; and then you 
shall chalk out every path that 1 
will set my foot in ; nor will I turn 
iiaide either to the right hand or 
to the left. 

You wish I had not mediated 
for you to your friends. I wish so 
too; because my mediation was 
ineffectual' because it may give 
oengrouna for the malice of some 
of them to work upon; and be- 
cause you are angry with me for 
doing so. But how, as X said in 
my former, could 1 sit down in 
quiet wbou I knew how uneasy 
tneir implacableness made you? 
— But 1 will tear myself from the 
subject; for 1 eee I shall be warm 
again — and displease you — and 
there is not one thing in the world 
that I would do, however agree- 
able to myself, if 1 thought 
would disoblige you:, u

that I wonld omit to do , if I knew 
it would give yon pleasure. And 
indeed, my dear half -severe friend, 
I will try if I cannot avoid the fault 
- 1 willingly as I would the rehike. 
For tbia reason , I forbear say- 
g aaythingon so nice a subject 
as your letter to your sister. It 
' be right, because you think 
— and if it ba taken 
ought, that will shew you that it 
is. But if it begets insults and r~ 
vilincB, as it is but too likely - 
I find you don't intend to let n

ment of your relations, 
have often told you, I cannot 
imitate you in this. It is not a 
necessary point of belief with me, 
that all people in years are Ihere- 
forewiBB; or tha.t all young people 
are therefure rash and headstrong : 
it may be generally the case, as 
far as I know : and possibly it may 
be so in the case ofViy mother and 
ftergbl: but I will venture to say, 
\ that it has not yet appeared to be 
so between the principals of Har- 
lowe Place, and their second 
daughter. 

You are for excusing them 

beforehand for their eapected 

cruelly, aanot knowing what you 

have suffered, nor how ill you are: 

they have heard of the former.and 

are not sorry for it ; of the latter, 

they have been lold, and / have 

I most reason to know how they 

H have taken it — but I shall be far 

I bom avoiding the fault, and as 



BUrely shall incur the rebuke, if I 
say any more upon this subject. I 
will therefore only add at present, 
that your reasonings ia their be- 
half shew jou to be ail excellence : 
their returns to you, that they are 
all — do, my dear, let me end with 
a tittle bit of spitefiil justice — but 
you won't, I know — so 1 have 
done, quite done, however re- 
luctantly: yet if you think of the 
word I would have said, don't 
doubt the justice of it, and fill up 
the blank with it. 

You intimate, that were I 
actually married, and Mr. Hick- 
man to desire it, you would think 
of obliging me with a, visit on the 
occasion', and that perhaps when 
with me, it would be difficult for 
you to remove far from me. 

Lord , my dear, what a stresa do 
you seem to lay upon Mr. Hick- 
man's desiring it ! — To he sure be 
does, and would of all things de> 
sire to have you near us, and vnlh 
us, if we might bo so favoured - 
policy, as well as veneration fbr 
ymi, would undoubtedly make the 
man,if n(itafool,rZf9!Ve this. Bnt 
let me tell you, that if Mr. Hi 
man, after marriage, should pre- 
tend to dispute with me my friend- 
ships, as 1 hope I am not quite a 
fool, I should let him know how 
far his own quiet was concerned in. 
such an impertinence; especially 
if they were aueh friendships ai 
were contracted before I knew him. 

I know I always differed frtim 




r 



dear, from a persoji of your BCDse 
and judgment, are no nnj advan- 
tageouB to ua; inasmucli aa they 
jiutify that assuming sex iu their 
insolence; when hardly one out 
of len of them, their opportuni- 
tiee considered, deserres any pre- 
rogative at all. Look through all 
the faraiiies we know; and we 
shall not find one-third of theun 
have half the sense of their wives. 
And yet these are to be vested 
with prerogatives! And a woman 
of twice their sense has nothiuK to 
do bat hear, tremble, and oBey 

— and for consciaiCg-aabB too, I 
warrant I 

But Mr. Hickman and I may 
perhaps have a little diacourae 
npontbesesort of subjects, before 
I suffer him to talk of the day: 
and then I shall let him know 
what he has to trust to ; as be will 
me, if he be a sincere man, what 
he pretends to expect from me. 
Bntletme tell yon, my dear, that 
it is more in your power, than per- 
haps you think it, to hasten the 
dsyso much pressed for by my mo- 
ther, as weir as wished for by you 

— for the very day that you caii 
KBsure me that yon are in a toler- 
able state of health, and have dis- 
charged yonr doclor and apothe- 
cary, at their own motions, on

letter of juat reprobation of the 
greatest profligate in the king-

done amiss that I transcribe some 
of the paragraphs of yourletterof

iiH you at first intended should be 

You are, it seems (and that too 
much for your health) emp!o;yed 
in writing: I hope it is in penning 
down the particulars of your tra- 
gical story. And my mother has 
put me in mind to press vou. to it, 
with a view, that one dav, if it 
might be published under feigned 
names, it would be of asmucnuse 
as honour to the sei. My mother 
says, she cannot help admiring 
you for the propriety of your re- 
sentment in your refusal of the 
wretch; and she would be ex- 
tremely glad to have her advice 
of penniug your sad story com- 
plied with. And then, she says, 
your noble conduct throughout 
your trials and calamities will 
afford not only a shining exaniplo 
to our sex, but at the same time 
(those calamities befalling ancR 
a person) a fearful wammg to 
the inconsiderate young creatures 

On Monday we shall set out on 
our Journey; and I hope to be 
back in a fortnight, and on my 
return will have one pull more 
with my mother for a London

I HiTE not been wanting to use 
nil my interest with my beloved

and be reconciled to your cousin 
(tlioagh he has eo ill deserved it)i 
iind have even repfatediaj earnest 
advice to her on this head. This 
repetition, and the waiting for her 
answer, having taken up time, 
have been the cause that I could 
not sooner do myself the honour 
of writing to yon on this subject. 

Yon will see by the inclosed, her

I but too much reason to appre- 
a well hy that, as by the 
report of a gentleman just come 
from her, that she is in such a de- 
cliningwaya^ to her health, that 
her thougnts are very differently 
employed than ou a continuance 

The inclosed letter she thought 
fit to send to me unsealed, that 
after I had penised it, I mleht for- 
ward it to you ; aiid this is the rea- 



son it is superscribed by myself, 
and sealed with my seal. It is 
very full and peremptory; but as 
she bad been pleased, in a letter 
to me, dated the 23d instant (aa 
soon as she could hold a pen) t» 
give inemore ample reasons why- 
she could not comply with your 
(resBiug requests, as well as mine, 
will transcribe some of tiie pas- 
sages in that letter, which v '" 
give one of the wickedest mOD 
the world (if he sees them) reat 
to think himself one of the most 
unhappy, in the loss of so incom-

an hopeful way, as to his health. 
He desires his duty to you. He is 
very low and weak, and so am I. 
But this is tbe first time that 1 
have been able, for several days 
past, to sit up to write, or I would 
not have been so long silent. 

Your letter to your sister is re- 
ceived and answered. You have 
the answer by this time, Isuppose. 
1 wish it may be to your satisfac- 
tion ; but am afraid it will not ; for, 
by Betty Barnes, I find they were 
in a great ferment on receiving 
^ours, and much divided whether 
It should be answered or not. 
They will not yet believe that you 
are so ill, as (to my infinite con- 
cern) I find you are. What passed 
between Miss Harlowe and Miss 
Howe, has been, as I feared it 
would be, an aggravation. 

1 shewed Betty two or three 
passages in your letter to me ; and 
she seemed moved, and said, she 
would report them favourably, 
and would procure me a visitfrom 
Miss Harlowe, if I would premise 
to shew the same to her. But 1 
have heard no more of that. 

Motbinks,! am sorry you refuse 
the wicked man: But doubt not, 
nevertheless, that your motives 
for doing so are more commend- 
able than my wishes that yoa 
would not. But as you would.be 
resolved, as I maj aa.'j , "MiNiie , 'A

yon gave way to aueh a thought; 
and as I have so much interest in 
yonr recovery; I cannot forbear 
shewing this ree; 

' ' ask you , S you cannot get 
your just reaentraent? — 
But I dare say no more on this 
sabject. 

What a dreadful thing indeed 
was it for my dearest tender young 
lady to be arrested in the streets 
fifLondonI — How does my heart 
go over again for you, what yours 
mnat have suffered at that time! 
— Yet this, to such a mind as 
yours, must be light, compared 
to what you had suffered before. 

my dearest Miss Clary, bow 
shall we know what to pray for, 
when we pray, but that (Voif,? will 
may be dnne, and that we may be 
resiffaed to ill — When at nine 
years old, and afterwards at 
eleven, you had adaogerous fever, 
how incessantly did we all grieve, 
and pray, and put up our vows to 
the throne of grace for your re- 
covery! — For all our lives were 
bound up in your life — yet iidm', 
my dear, as it has proved (espe- 
cially if we are soon to lose yon) 
what ftmuchmoredeBirableeveut, 
both for you and for us, would 
it have been, had we then lost 
you. 

A sad thing to say ! but as it is 
in pure love to yon that I say it, 
and in full conviction that we are 
not always fit to be our own 
choosers, I hope it may be ex- 
cusable: and the rather, as the 
same reflection will naturally lead 
both you and me to acquiesce 
ujider the present dispensation:

But to what purpose? — Don't 
send it — I charge you, don't — 
I dare not see it — 

Yet — 

But, alas! — 

forgive the almost distracted 
mother! You can. 

You know how to allow for all 
this. — So I will let it go. — I will 
not write over again this part of 
my letter. 

But I choose not to know more 
of her, than is communicated to 
us all — no more than I dare own 
I have seen — and what some of 
them may rather communicate to 
me , than receive from me : and 
this for the sake of my outward 
quiet! Although my inward peace 
suffers more and more by the com- 
pelled reserve. 

* * * 

1 was forced to break off. But 
I will now try to conclude my long 
letter. 

I am sorry you are ill. But if 
you were well, I could not, for 
your own sake, wish you to go up, 
as Betty tells us you long to do. 
If you went, nothing would be 
minded that came from you. As 
they already think you too partial 
in her favour, your going up would 
confirm it, and do yourself preju- 
dice, and her no good. And as 
every body values you here, I ad- 
vise you not to interest yourself 
too warmly in her favour, espe- 
cially before my Bella's Betty , till 
I can let you know a proper time. 
Yet to forbid you to love the dear 
naughty creature, who can? O 
my Norton I you must love her I — 
And so must I J 



I send you five guineas-, to help 
you in your present illness, and 
your son's; for it must have lain 
heavy upon you. What a sad, 
sad thing, my dear good woman, 
that all your pains, and all my 
pains, for eighteen or nineteen 
years together, have, in so few 
mouths, been rendered thus de- 
plorably vain! Yet I must be al- 
ways your friend, and pity you, 
for the very reason that I myself 
deserve every one's pity. 

Perhaps I may find an oppor- 
tunity to pay you a visit, as in 
your illness, and then may weep 
over the letter you mention, with 
you. But for the future, write 
nothing to me about the poor girl, 
that you think may not be com- 
municated to us all. 

And I charge you, as you value 
my friendship, as you wish my 
peace, not to say any thing of a 
letter you have from me , either to 
the naughty one, or to any body 
else. It was some little relief (the 
occasion given) to write to you, 
who must, in so particular a man- 
ner, share my affliction. A mother, 
Mrs. ^Norton, cannot forget her 
child, though that child could 
abandon her mother; and, in so 
doing, run away with all her mo- 
ther's comforts! — As I can truly 
say, is the case of

the man, whose gratitude I wished 
to engage, and whose protection 1 
was the more entitled to expect,

other, and reduced me to an ab- 
solute dependence upon himself. 
Indeed I once thought that it was 
all his view to briog me to this (as 
ho hated my family ;) and uncom- 
fortable enough forme, if it had 
been all. 

Can it be thought, my dear, that 
"'heart was aot more thauhalf

But with my relations it is otken-

must mean a slight to her. 

If any thing could give 
relish for life, after what I have 



iterly love, which has, for years, 
uninterruptedly bound us together 
as one mind. — And why, my dear, 
shonld yon defer giving (by a tie 
ttill stronger) another friend to 
Dne who has so few?

CLARISSA HARI.OWE. 



I have nothing to apprehend of 
tbiaeort.if 1 have the jtutice done 
ineinhialefters.whichMr.Belford 
asenres me I have: and therefore 
the particalarB of my story, 
thebaseartsof thiavileraan, .._, 
1 think, be best collected from 
those very letters of his (if Mr. 
Belfbrd can be prevailed upon to 
commuDicate them;) to trbich I 
dare appeal witli the same tnith 
and fervour as he did, who says — 
Oh thai one moiUil hear me ! and thai 
mine adi'eraart/ liad vrrilten a hook. 
— Surely , / Kould take ii upon mif 
lAoalders, and bind if to me 
crmeni For I covered not my tt 
greirieni, axAdmn, bg hiding 
inimrity fn my ftojom. 

There is one way which may be 
follea upon to induce Mr. Belford 
to communicate theaa lettera; 
sinoe he seems to have (and de- 
clares he always had] a sincere 
abhorrence of hiB friend's baaeneaa 
to me : hot that, you'll say , when 

S?n hear it, is a strange one. 
evertheless, I am very earnest 
upon it at present. 
It ia no other than this: 
1 think to make Mr. Belford the 
esecutor of my laat will [don't be 
surprised:] and with this view I 
permit his visits with the less 
Bcrupie: and every time I see him, 
from bisconcemfor me, am more 
and more inclined to do so. If 1 
hold in the same mind , and if he 
uecepttbe tmst, and will commu-, 
nicate the materials in his power, i 
those, joined with what you can 
famieh, will answer the whole 
ead. ' 

J know you will start at my 



notion of such an eiecutor: but 
pray, my dear, consider, in my 
present circumstances, what I can 
do better, aa I am empowered to 
makeawill, and have considerable 
matters in my own disposal. 

Your mother, lam sure, would 
not consent that you should take 
this office upon you. Itmightsub- 
Ject Mr. Hickman to the insulta of 
that -violent man. iUr*. Noyton 
cannot, for several reasons re- 
specting herself. My brother looka 
upon what I ought to have , as his 
right: my iinc/e//(iWnuJBi3already 
one of my trustees (as my cousin 
Morden is the other) for the estate 
my grandfather left me: butyou 
see I could not get from my own 
family the few guineas I left be- 
hind me at Harlowe Place; and 
my uncle AnlonJ/ once threatened 
tohavemy crandfathei-'awillcon- 
troverfed. My father! — To be 
sure, my dear, Icouhlnot eipect 
that my father would do all I wish 
ihould be done: and a teiil to 
je executed by a father for a 
daughter, (parts of it, perhaps, 
absolutely against his own judg- 
ment) carries somewhat daring 
and prescriptive in the very word. 

If indeed myousinJVfordenwere 

come in time, and would under- 
take this trust — but even Aim it 

ight subject to hazards ; and the 
more, as he ia a man of great 
spirit, and as the other man (of ns 
great) looks upon ma (unpro- 
tected aslhave long been) aahia 
property. 

Now Mr. Hclford, as I have al- 
ready mentioned, kuowa every- 
thing that baa paa»ft4. lie \* i

man of spirit, and, it Sbems, as 
fearless as the otiier, with more 
linmane qualities. You don't 
know, my dear, what inatancea of 
sincere humauity this Mr. Belford 
has shewn, not ouly 



the truel a 



, but 






ce.And Mrs. Li 
baB taken pains to inquire after 
Ilia general character-, and hears 
ayery goodoueof hiiLi, for justice 
and generosity in all bja concerns 
of iHmit and Tuum, &a they are 
called: be has a knowledge of taw 
taatters; and has two executor- 
shipa upon him at this time, in the 
discharge of which his lionour is 
anquestioned. 

All these reasons have already 
in a manner determined me to ask 



roake an intimate friend of Mr. 
Lovelace my eiecutor. 

This is certain: my brother will 
be more acquiescent a great deal 
in such a case with the articles of 
my will, as he will see, that it will 
be to no purpose to coutrovert 
some of them, which else, Idare 
say, he would controvert, orper- 
■uade my other friends to do so. 
And who would involve an exe- 
cutor in a laW'Suit, if they could 
help it? — Which would be the 
case, if any body were left whomjto take 
my brother could hopi 



OP 

you may believe, to have effects 
torn out of my father's hands: 
while Mr. Belford, who is a man of 
fortune (and a good economist in 
his own affairsV, would have no 
interest but to ao justice. 

Then he exceedingly pi 
some occasion to shew his readi- 
ness to serve me: andhewoaldbA 
able to manxge his violent friend, 
over whom he lias moreinflueuca 
than any othevpi 

But, after all, Iknownot, ifit' 
were not more eligible by far, that 
my story and ta^sdf luo, should ba: 
forgotten as soon as possible. Anl 
of this 1 shall have toe less doubtf , 
if the character of my parenti 
[you will forgive me, my dear 
cannot be guarded against the 
unqualified bitterness, which, troni 
your affectionate zeal for ir

— a point that mii/lil, ana (I inmat 
upon it) must be well considered 
of, if any thing be done which your 
mother and you are desiroos to 
have done. The generality of ths 
world is too apt to oppose a, du- 



control; since my father has poa- 
aeesion of all , and ia absolutely 
governed by him. [Angry spirits, 
my dear, as 1 have often aeen, will 
be overcome by more angry ones, 
as well as sometimes be disarmed

heard for me. Yet, you bid me yourself enemies besides, if you 
hope, that the gruce 1 sued for, : were to come to me — don't you 
would, in tiiae, be granted. see that you would? 

The grace I then sued for was Mr. Brand may come, if hewilK 
indeed granted: but you are | He isaclergjm: 



afraid, you say, that they will 
wait for Mr. Brand's report, be- 
fore favour will be obtained in re- 
turn to the second letter which I 
wrote to my aiater; and you add, 
that I hare an indulgent mother, 
were she at liberty to act accord- 
ing to her own inclination; and 
that all will end well at last. 

But what, my dear Mrs.Norton, 
what is the grace I sue for in my 
second letter? — It ia not that 
they will receive me into favour 
— if they think it ia, they are 
mistaken. 1 do not, 1 cannot ex- 
pect that; nor, as I have often 
said, should I, if the^ icaulrl re- 
ceive me, bear to live in the eye of 
those dear frienda whom 1 have so 
grievously offended. 'Tia only, 
simply, a bleaaingi ask ; a bieaaing 
to die with, not to liae with. — Do 
they know that? And do ther 
know that their unkindneas will 
perha^ia shorten my date? So that 
their favour, if ever they intend *" 
grant it, may eomc too late. 

Once more, I desire jou not to 
think of coming to me. I have tio 
uneasiness now, but what pro- 
ceeds from the apprehenaion of 
seeing a man 1 woiild not see for 
the world, if I could help it; and 
from the severity of my nearest 
and dearest relations: aseverity

iieighten their severity, and make 




think so, let him

fear is, that, as he knows lamia 
disgrace with a family whose 
esteem lie is desirous to cultivate; 
and as he baa obligations to my 
uncle Harlo we, and to my father, 
he will be bat a languid acquitter 

— not that I am sB'aid of what ,

I most confoundedly cha- 
and disappointed: for 
on Saturday, arrived a 
meseengcr from Miaa Howe with 
a letter to my cousins*; which 1 
kueir nothiog of till yesterday: 
when Lady Sarah and Lady Betty 
were procured to be here, to ait 
in judgment upon it with the old 
peer, and my two cousins. And 



what? — Why, for the cruelty 
of Miss Harlowe: for have 1 com- 
mitted any new offence? And 
would I not have reinstated my- 
^'" "i her favour upon her own 
I I'l could? And is it fair 
E punish me for what is my mis- 
~ ttHsneTzli.ottblarol, \ 




fortune, andnotmy fault? Such 
eeail-jnilging fools as 1 have for 
my relations! I am aahamcd of 
them all. 

In that of Miss Howe was in- 
closed one to her from Miss Har- 
lowe*, to be tranamitted to mj 
cousins, containing a final rejec- 
tion of me; and that in very vehe- 
ment and positive terms; yet she 
pretenda, that in this rejection 
she is governed more hv principle 
than passion — [D—d lie as ever 
-wastoldil And, as aproof that 
she is, says, that she rnii forgive 
me, and does on this one con- 
dition, that I will never moleat 
her more — the whole letter so 
written, as to make hersulf moto 
admired, rnc more detested. 

What we have been told of the 
agitations and workings , and 
Bigbings and sobbinga, of the 
French prophets among us for- 
merly, was nothing at all to the 
scene exhibited by theae maudlin 
souls, at the reading of these 
letters; and of some affecting paa- 
sages extracted from another of 
my fair implacable's to MissHowo 
— such lamentations for the loss 
of BO charming a relation I Such 
applaudings of her virtue , of her 
esaltednesa of soul and sentiment! 
Such menaces of dis-inherisonal I, 
not needing their reproaches to be 
stung to the heart with my own 
reflections, and with the rage of 
disappointment; and as sincerely 
as any of them admiring ber — 
"What the devil," cried I. "is all

that I will solemnly resign that,

to letters or advices brought her 
from her implacable family, 

I have now completed my

to Epaom, to endeavour to put 
Belton's sister into possession of

which, I shall devote myself whol*

the lady. 

I was admitted to her presence 
last night; and found her visiblr

went home, I had your letter of

1 infinitely obliged to you 

for your kind and condeacendina 
letter. Aletter, however, whicE 
heightens my regrets, as itgivea 
me a new instance of what ahappy 
creature I might have been in an 
alliance bo much approved of by 
such worthy ladies, and which, 
on their accounts , and on thatoi 
Lord M, vpould hare been so re- 
putable to myself, and was once

But, indeed, indeed, madam, 
ray heart sincerely repulses the 
man, who, descended from such a 
ismily, could be guilty, /irgt, of 
such premeditated violence as be 
has been guilty of; and, as /it 
knows, further intended me, on the 
"ight previous to the day he set 
oulfor Berkshire; and. ner.l, pre-

Permit me, however, to make 
one request to my good Lord M. 
and to Lady Betti', and Lady 
Sarah, audtoj'ourkiiidsdf, and 
your sister — it ia, that you will 
all be pleased to join your autho- 
rity and interests to prevail upon 
Mr. Lovelace not to molest me 
further. 

Be pleaaed to tell him, that, if 1 
am designed tor life, it will be very 
cruel in him to attempt to hunt 
me out of it; for I am determined 
never to see him more, if I can 
help it. The more cruel, because 
he knows, thatl have nobody to 
defend me from him: nor do I 
wish to engage any body to to 
hurt, orto their own. 

If I am, on the other baud, des- 
tined for death, it will be no leas 
cruel, if he will uot permit mo to

and bappy end I wish him. In'

leturned, nitbout taking a cupy 
of it. The contente of it will booh 
be communicated to you, I pre- 
sume, by other handj. They are 
an abflolute rejection of thee — 
Poor Lovelace! — 



Tod have frequently offered to 
oblige me in any thing that ehall 
be within your power: andlhave 
such an opinion of you, as to be 
willing to hope , that at the times 
you made these offers, youmeaut 
more than mere compliment. 

I have, therefore, two requests 
to make you: the first I will now 
mention; tlieother,if this shall be 
complied with , otherwise not. 

It behoves me to leave beliind 
me such an account as may clear 
up my conduct to several of my 
friends who will not at present 
concern themselves about mc: 
and MisB Howe, and her mother, 
are very solicitous that 1 will 
dOBO. 

I am apprehensive that I shall 
not have time to do this; and you 
wiUnotwonderthatlhavelessand 
less inclination to set about such 
a paiufal task; especially as I 
find myself unable to look back 
with patience on what I have 
suffered: and sball be too much 
discomposed by the retrospection, 
werelobliged tomake it, to pro- 
ceed with we reiiuiajte temper in 
a task of slill greater importance 
which I have before me.

It is very evident to me, that 
your wicked friend has givea yon, 
from time to time, acircunu^n- 
tial account of all his behaviour 
lo me, and devices ai7ai>ijf me; and 
you have more than once assured 
me, that he has done mycliaracter 
all the justice I could wish for, 
both by writiog and speech. 

Now, sir, if 1 may have a fair, a 
faithful specimen from his letter* 
or accounts to you, written upon , 
some of the most interesting oc-- 
caeious , I shall be able to judge, 
whether there will or will not be a 
necessity forme, formy hononr'a 
sake, to enter upon the solicited 

You may be assured, frvm mT 
indused answer to the letter whim 
Miss Montague has honoured ma, 
with (and which you will bft' 
pleased to return me aa soon m 
read) that it is impossible for gift' 
everto think of your friendinttift' 
way I am importuned to thinic oC: 
him: he cannot therefore receivo' 
any detriment from the requested 
specimen; and I give ' 
honour, that no use -'--"^ 
of it to his prejudic'

after I am no more , I assure you 
that it is a main pari of my vita, 
that the passages you shall oblige 
me with shall be always in yoor 
own power, andnotin thatolany 
other person. 

If, sir, you think fit to complr

ISotr, Lovelace, since there are

never offered (tM jiiore lUminiiliiv

she may be made easier by it — 
since thou must fare better from

and, finally, since tbyactions have 
manifested, that thy letters are 
not the most guilty part of what 
she i'nom:' of tnee — I see not why 
I may not oblige her, upon her 
honour, and under the restrictions, 
aud for the reasons she has given ; 
and this without breach of the 
confidence due to friendly com- 
munications; especially asl might 
have added, Since Ihnu glorieit in \

it be any thing less than cutting 
% throat, or endangering my own 
neck, I will certainly comply, and 
be proud of having it in my power 
to oblige her. 

And now I am actually going to 
be busy in the extracts. 



You have engaged me to com- 
municate to you, upon honour, 
(making neither better nor worse 
of the matter) what Mr. Lovelace 
bas written to me in relation to 
youraelf, in the period preceding 
your going to Hampatead, and in

have no view in this request, out 
to see if it be necessary for yon, 
from the account he gives, to 
touch the painful subjects your- 
self, for the sake of your own 
character. 

Your commands, madam, are of 
a very delicate nature, as IIict 
may seem to affect the r&reu of

"And now, madam," — See t}ie 
jinriigrapli marted loi'lA inferted

The lady is extremely imea^ 
lit the thoughts of your attempt- 
ing to visit her. For heaven's sake 
(yom* word being given) and for 
pity's sake {for she is really in a 
very weak and languiahiDg way) 
let me beg of you not to tliink 
ofit. 

Yesterday afternoon she re- 
ceived a cruel letter (as Mrs, Lo- 
vick supposes it to be, by the 
effect it had upon her) from her 
sister in answer to one written 
last Saturday, entreating a bless- 
ing and forgiveness from her pa- 
She acknowledges, that if the 
same decency andjnstice are ob- 
served in all your letters, as id the 
extracts I have obliged her with 
(as I have assured her tliey are), 
she shall think herself freed from 
the necessity of writing her own 
story: and this is an advantage 
to thee which thou oughtest to 
thank me for. 

But what thinkest thou is the 
second request she bad to make to 
me? No other than that 1 would 
be her ej-eculorl — Her motives 
will appear before thee in proper 
time; and then, I dare to answer, 
will be satisfactory. 

Yon cannot imagine how proud 
I am of this trust. I am afraid 
1 shall too soon come into the 
execution of it. As she is al- 
ways writiiiE, what a melancholy 
pleasure will the perusal and dis- 
position of her papers afeni ifiO.

I AH juat returned from viaiting 
the lady, and thanking her ' 
son for the honour she ha; 
me; and aasuring her, ifcalledto 
the sacred trust, of the utmost 
fidelity and exactneaa. 

I found her very ill. 1 took

ceived a second hard-hearted 
letter from her aister; and 



both together — otlierwiae, 
her aiater's aake, it were no matter 
how few saw the poor Bella',

I knew she would be displeased 
if I had censured the cruelty of 
her relations: I therefore only 
said, that surely alie must havs 
enemies, who hoped to find their 
account in keeping u 
aentments of her fricu^ against

But you only hope for /ar- 
pr'uenssji, and a blessing, you aay. 
A blessing for what, sisterClary? 
Think for whati - However. I 
re'd your letter to my father and 
mother. 

I won't tell you what my father 
said ^ one who has the true sense 
you boast to have of your mis- 
deeds, may guess, without my 
teliiug you, what a justly incensed 
father would say on such an occa- 

My poor mother — O wretch! 
what has not your ungrateful folly 
cost my poor mother! — Had you 
been less a darling, you would 
not, perhaps, have oeen so grace- 
less: hut 1 never iu my life saw a 
cockered favourite come to good. 

My heart is full, and 1 can't 
help writing my mind; for your 
crimes have disgraced us all ; and 
I am aft'aid and ashamed to go to 
any public or private assembly or 
diversion: — Ineed not say why, 
when your actions are the subject 
either of the opeu talk , or of the 
afirpnting whispers, of both sexes 
at all such places. 

Upon the whole, I am sorry I 
have uo more comfort to send 
you: but I find nobody willing to 
forgive you. 

1 don't know what lime may do 
for you ; and when it is seen that 
your penitence is not owing more 
to disappointment than to true 
conviction; for it is toopropable, 
Miss Clary, that, had you gone on

No self- convicted criminal e?-er 
approached her angry and just

by these lines. 

Indeed I must aay, that if the

not respected my future welfare, I 
had aot dared to taite this liberty. 
But my heart is set upon it, as 
upon a thing next to tiod Al-

Had my happy siater known my 
distreascH, she would not have 
wrung my heart, as she has done, 
by a severity which I must needs 
tliiuk unkind and unsisterly. 

But complaint of any uukind-

that it must be seen that my peni-

humble prayer is founded upon a 
true and unfeigned repentance: 
and this you will the readier b* 
lieve, if the creature whenever, 
thebeat of herfcmembrance, told 
her mamma a wilful falsehood, 
may be credited, when she de- 
clarer, as she does in the most so-

seducer with a determination not, 
to go off with him : that the rSall' 
step was owing more to compul'

Little as I have reason to ex- 
pect either your patient ear, or 
forgiving heart, yet cannot I for- 
bear to write to you once more (as 
a more pardonable intrusion, per- 
haps, than a visit would be), to 
beg of you to put it in my power 
to atone, as far as it is possible 
to atoue, for the injuries I have 
done you. 

Your angelic purity, and my 
awakened conscience, are stand- 
ing records of your eialted merit, 
and of my detestable baBeness: 
but your forgivcneaa will lay me 
under an eternal obligation te 
you. — Forgive me then, my dear-

visible anchor of my future hope!

THE HISTORy OF 



Tburida)- nlghl, Aug. 10. 

You have been infonned bj 
Tourville, how much iJelton'a ili- 
nesB aod affairs have engaged me, 
A3 well as Mowbray and h[m,BiiicE 
my former. I called at Smith'* 
on Monday in my way to Epaom. 

The lady wae gone to chapel: 
but I had the satisfaction to hear 
Bte was not worse; a,Dd left my 
compliments, and an intimation 
that 1 should be out of town for 
tbree or four days. 

I refer myself to Tourville, who 
will let you know the difficulty we 
had to arive out this meeJ' mistress, 
and frugal manager, with her 
cubs, and to give the poor fel- 
low's sister poaaession for him of 



□ bouse; heskulliing 
while at an inn at Croyd< 
dispirited to appear * ' 









But I must observe, that we 
were probably but just in time to 
save the nhaltered remains of his 
fortune from this rapacious wo- 
man, and her accomplices; for as 
he cannot live long, and she thinks 
HO, we found she had certainly 
taken measures to set up a mar- 
riage, and keep possession of a^U 
for nerself and her sons. 

Tourville will tell you how I 
was forced to chastise the quon- 
dam hostler in heraigbt, before I 
could drive him out of the house. 
He had the insolence to lay hands 
on me: and Imade him take but 
one step from the top to the bot- 
tomof apair ofstairs. Ithought 



his neck and alt his bones bad 
been broken. And then, he being 
carried out neck and heels, 
Thomaeine thought fit to walk 
out after him. 

Charming consequences of jtfeyi- 
iitg; the state we have been ao 
fond of estoUine! — Whatever 
it may be thought of ia strong 
healtb, .ikknessaad'lectimiigspiriU 
in the keeper, will bring him to 
see the di£l«rence. 

She should soon have him, she 
told a confidant I in the space of 
sii feet by five; meaning his bed; 
and then she would let nobody 
come near him but whom Bha 
pleased. The hostler fellow, I 
suppose, would then have been hia 
physician: his will ready madofor 
him; and widows' weeds probably 
ready provided; who knows, but 
she to appear in tbem in his own 
sight? _ As once I knew an in- 
stance in a wicked wife, insulting 
a husband she hated, when she 
thoughthimpastrecovery^thougb 
itgave the man such spirits, and 
Bucb a turn, that he got over it, 
and lived to see her in her coffin, 
dressed out in the very weeds she 
had insulted him in. 

Ho much, for the present, for 
Belt«n, and his Thomasine. 

I begin to pity thee heartily, 
now I see thee in earnest, in the 
fruitless iovo thou expressest tO 
this angel of a woman; and the 
rather, as, say what thou wilt, it is 
impossible she should get over her 
illness, and her Irieiida' imnla- 
cableness, of which she has nad 
fresh instances.

CaJjUSSA HAHLOWE. 



► Ifaope thou art not indeed dia- 
pleaaed with tiie esttacfB I have 
madefromthyletterBforher. The 
tettiag her know the justice thou 
hast done to her virtue in them, is 
so much in favour of thy inge- 
nDouaneBB (a quality, let me re- 
peat, that gives thee a superiority 
over common libertines) that I 
thiuk in my heart I was right; 
though to any other woman, and 
to one who had not known the 
worst of thee that she could know, 
it might have been wrong. 

If the enrf will justify the means, 
it is plain, that I have done well 
with regard to ye both; since I 
have made her easier, and Ihee ap- 
pear in a better light to her, than 
otherwise thou wouldst have done. 

But if, nevertheless, thou art dia- 
satiafied with my having obliged 
her in a point, which lacknow- 
ledge ru he Jdicate, let us canvass 
this matter at our first meeting; 
and then I will shew thee what the 
extracts <i)ere, and what counec- 
tions I gave them in thy favour. 

Butsurely thou dost notpretend 
\o say wbatl shall, or shallnot do, 
as to the esccutorship ! 

I am my ownman, I bope. I 
think thou sbouldst be glad to 
have the justificatjot] of her me- 
mory left to one, who, at the same 
time, tbonmay'stbe assured, will 
treat thee , and thy actions , with 
all the lenity the case will admit. 

1 cannot help espressing my 
surprise at one instance of thy 
selt- partiality ; and that is, where 
thou sayest, she had need, indeed, 
U CT)' out for meicy herself from 



/ler friends, whoknowsnot how to 
shew any. 

Surely thou canst not think the 
cases alike — for she , as 1 under- 
stand , desires but a last blessing, 
and a last forgiveness , for a fault 
in a manner inooltmlanj , if a fault 
at all; and does not so mnch as 
*ope to berecer'DBtZ,- thou, to be for- 
given premedil'iteil wrongs (which, 
nevertheless, she forgives, on con- 
dition to be no more molested by 
thee); and hopest to be received 
into faauur, and to make the finest 
jewel in the world thy absolute 

Sco[)erty in consequence of that 
irgiveneas. 

Iwill now briefly proceed to re- 
late what has passed since my 
last, as to the excellent lady. By 
) the account I aball give thee, thou 
wilt see, that she has troubles 
enough upon her, all springing 
originally from thyself, without 
needing to add more to them by 
new vexations. And aa long as 
thou canst exert thyself so very 
cavalierly at M. Hall, where every 
one is thy prisoner, I see not but 
the bravery of thy spirit may be 
aa well gratified m domineering 
there over half a dozen persons ot 
rank and distinction, as it could 
be over an helpless orphan, as I 
may call this lady, since she boa 
not a single iriend to stand by her, 
if I do not; and who will think 
herself happy, if she can refuge 
herself from thee, and Irom all tie 
world, in the arms of death.

Mr. Smitli and his wife, were with 
her. After beiDg at Highgate 
Chapel at divine service, she 
treated them with a little repast; 
and in the afternoon wasi at Is- 
lington Church , in her way home ; 
rehiroiag tolerably cheerful. 

She had received several letters 
in my absence, aa Mrs. Lovick ae- 
guaintedme, besides yours. Yours, 
itaeema, much diatreased her; but 
she ordered the meaneiiger, who 
pressed for an answer, to be told, 
that it did not require an imme- 

On Wednesday, she received a 
letter from lier uncle Harlowe*, 
in answer to one she had written 
to her mother on Saturday 
knees. It must be a very crnel 
one, Mrs. Lovick says, by the ef- 
feels it had upon her: for, when 
she received it, she was intending 
to take an afternoon aii-ing in a 
coach, hot was thrown into bo 
violent a fit of hysterica upon it, 
that she was forced to lie down; 
and (being not recovered by it) to 
go to bed about eight o'olouk. 

On Thursday morning she waa 
up very early; and haa recourse 
to the BCripturea to calm her mind, 
as she told Mrs. Lovick: and, 
weak aa she was, would so in a 
chair to Lincoln's-inn Chapel, 
about eleven. She was brought! 
home a little better; and then sat! 
down to write to her uncle. But| 
waa obliged to leave off several] 
timea — to struggle, as she told 
MrB,Lovick,foran humble temper. I 
"My heart," said she to the good 
woman, "is a proud heart, and 
•Seeiet»m& • ■ ( 



notyet, I£nd, enough mortified 
to my condition; but, do what { 
can, will ho for preseribing ro. 
sen ting thing;s to my pen." 

1 arrived in town ^om Belton'i. 
this Thursday evening, and went 
directly to Smith's. She waa too 
ill to receive my visit. But 04 
sending up my compliments, she 
sent me down word, that ' ' 
should be gtad to see me in 
morning. 

Mrs. Lovick obliged me wiUl 
the copy of a meditation*collectetf ' 
by the lady from the Scriptoreft. 
She haa intitled it, Poor moriat~ 
the cause ofOmr imn misery; w ia 
titled, I presume, with intentiul 
to take off the edge of her repia^ 
ings at hardships so dispropor^ 
tiooed to her fault, wereherfault 
even as great as she is inclined M'. 
think it. We may see by thifc; 
the method she tiikcs to forti^ 
her mind , and to which she owei 
in a great measure , the maf-""-'

deserved persecutions.

a rery different fashion; for that 
Nature was her guide in every 
thing, and Eaue her study ; which, 
joined with a. mingled dignity and 



ner, whether she received or paid 
a coiapliment, distinguiBhed her 
iibove all her sex. 

"He Bpoke not, he esid, his 
own sentiments only on this occa- 
eioii, hut those of every body : for 
that the praises of Miss Clarissa 
Harlowe were such a favourite 
topic, that a person who could 
not speak well upon any other 
sabject, was sure to speak well 
upon that; because he could say 
nothing but what he had heard re- 
peated and applauded twenty 
times over." 

Hence it was, perhaps, that 
t^iis novice accounted for the best 
things he said himself; though I 
must own that the personal know- 
ledge of the lady which I am fa- 
voured with, made it easy to me 
to lick into ahape what the good 
woman reported to me, as the 
character given ker by the young 
levite: forwho, evonno " "" " 
decline of health, sees 
all these attributes belong to her ? 

I suppose he has not been long 
come from college, and now thinks 
' he has nothing to do , but to blaze 
away for a scholar among the 
v/nnrant; as such young fellows 
ace apt to think thoee who cannot 
cap verses with them, and tell us 
how an ancient author expressed 
huDself in Latin on a subject, 
upon which, however, they may 
know how, as well as that author, 
to eipresB thenuelvea in Kngliah. 



Mrs. Smith was so taken with 
him, that she would fain havoin- 
troduced him to the lady, not 
questioning but it would be very 
acceptable to her to see one naa 
knew her and her friends so nelli 
but this he declined for aeva'al 
reasons^ as he called them; which 
he gave. One was, that peraonl 
of his cloth should be very caiii- 
tiouB of the compuny they kwm m, 



,andwhereawomashadiiuri^ 
her repulalion — [I wish I had been 
there when he gave himself these 
airsj. Another, that he was de- 
sired to inform himself of her pre- 
sent way of life, and vrfao bet 
visitors were; for, as to the prw*ei 
Mrs. Smith gave the lady, be 
hinted, that ska seemed to be > 
good-natured woman, and might 
(though for the lady's sake h> 
hoped not) be too partial and 
short-sighted to be tmsted to ab- 
solutely, in a concern of so high A 
nature, as he intimated the task 
was which he had undertaken; 
nodding out words of doubtful im- 
port; and assuming aira of great 
significance (as I could gather] 
throughout the whole conversa- 
tion. And when Mrs, Smith told 
him, that the lady was in a vei; 
bad state of health, he gava > 
careless shrug — She may be very 



f dare say, yet, to atone for 
very great lapse, and to expeet to

I could not look forward to my

with a contrition so lieep, that I 
deserved not, weie it known, to 
be turned over from the tender 
nature of a mother, to the np- 
braidiug peu of an uncle ! and to 
be wounded by a cruel question, 
pat by bim in a shocking man- 
ner; and which a little, a 
very tittle time, will better an- 
swer than I can: for I am not 
either a hardened or shameless 
creature: if 1 were, I should not 
have been so solicitous to obtain 
the favour 1 sued for.

asked it as well for my father and

Ism sure, theijal least will be un-

I CAN write Just now but a few

the saiind of that Mr. Belfonl for 



your eieeutor, cogent aa your 
reasons for that measure are: and 
yet 1 am firmly of opinion, that 
none of your reiationa should be 
named for the trust But I dwell 
the less upon this subject, as I 
hope (and cannot bear to appre- 
hend the contrary) that you will 
still live many, many years.

I have a particular opportunity 
of sending this by a friend of my 
aunt flarman's; who is ready to 
set out for London (and this occa- 
sions my hurry) and is to return 
immediately. I expect therefore 
by him a large packet from you ; 
and hope and long for news of 
your amended health : which 
Leave n grant to the prayers of 
Your ever affectionate 

Anna Howe. 



I wn.1, send you a large packet,

but not all that is come to my

friends are very severe; too severe 
for any body who loves them not,

dear, would not call them my' 
frrends, you said, long ago; but 
my relatiatis: indeed I cannot caU 



them my relations, I think ! — But 
I am ill; and therefore perhapa 
moreneevish than I should be. It 
is dimcult to go out of oumelvfl

As Mr. Belford has transcribed

friend's letters, the passages which 
accompany this, I must insist, that 
you suffer no soul but yourself to 
peruse them; and that you return 
them by the very first oppor-

made of them that may do hurt

Ab your uncle Harlowe ohooBea 
It to answer your pert letter to 
him; and as mmo written to you 
before,* was written as if it were 
in the spirit of prophecy, as you 
have found to your sorrow; and 
as you are now making yourself 
worse than you are in your health, 
and better than you are in your 
penitence, an me are very well iw-

as board, no doubt (for is not bia

don't be ashamed to be asked 
after what may naturally come of 
such free living. This modesty, 
indeed, would have become you 
for eighteen years of your life — 
you'll be pleased to mark that — 
but makes no good figure com- 
pared with your behaviour since 
the beginning of April last. So 
pray don't take it up, and wipe

But, may-be, Ilikewiseamtoo

Your folly has ruined all our 
peace. And who knows where it 
may yet end? — Your poor father 
but yesterday shewed mo this 
text; with bitter grief he shewed 
it me, poor man ; and do you lay it 
to your heart : 

"A fatherwaketh for his daugh- 
ter, when no man knowetfa', and 
the core of her taketh away his

All your friends here, my dear 
young lady, now seem set upon 
proposing to you to go to one of 
the plantations. This, 1 believe, 
to some misrepresenta- 
Mr. Brand; from whom 
they have received a letter. 

Iwish, with all my heart, that 
you could, consistently withyour 
WD notions of honour, yield to 
he pressing request of all Mr,

that he is. 

1 should be very glad to have in 
readiness, upon occasion, soma 
brief particulars of your sad story 
under your own band. But let mt 
tell you, at the same time, that nA 
misrepresentations, nor even yaax 
own confession, shall lessen my 
opinion either of your piety, or M 
your prudence in essential point«t : 
becaiisel know itwas always your 
humble way to make light faulta

who ever had so few, and those

THE inSTORY OF 

LETTEH XLVm. and also partieulawjOrbriefheadfl 

of my sadatory, in order toaerva 
me SB occasions shall offer. 1 
dear good Mrs. Norton, you Eh 
have a whole packet of papers, 
which I have sent to my JUisB 
Howe, when she returns them; 
and you Bhail have likewise an- 
other packet (and that with this ' 
letter) which I cannot at present < 
think of Bending to that deaf ' 
friend, for the Bake of my c 
retttliims; whom, without aeo; 
that packet, she is but too ready 
to cenaure heavily. From theae 
you will be able to collect a great 
dealof my story. But for what i*. 
previous to these papers, and' 
which mare particularly relatea td-' 
what I have suffered from vLr. 
Lovelace, you must have patience! 
for at present 1 have neither heM' 
norheartfor such subjects. Thti 
papers 1 send you with th^, will. 
be those mentioned in thejinaiv 
gin,* Tou must restore them ta 
me as soon as perused; and npou 
your honour make no use of them^ 
or of any intelligence you hav* 



What Mr. Brand, or any body, 
can have written or said to my 
prejudice, I cannot imagine; and 
yet some evil reports have gone 
out against me ; as I find by some 
hints, in a very severe letter writ- 
ten to me by my uncle Antony. 
Such a letter as I believe never 
was written to any poor creature, 
whoby ill health of body, as well 
as mind , was before tottering on 
the brink of the grave. But my 
iriends may possibly be better 
justified than the reporters^ for 
who knows what they may have 
heard? 

You give me a kind caution, 
which seems to imply more than 
you express, when you advise me 
against countenancing visitors 
that may discredit me. You 
should, in so tender B point, my 
dear Mrs. Norton, have apoken 
quite out. Surely, I have had 
afflictions enough to strengthen 
my miud , and to enable it to bear 
the worst that can now happen. 
But I will not puzzle myself by 
conjeclural euiVs; as I miijhl per- 
haps do, if I had not enough that 
were certain. 1 shall hear all, 
when it is thought proper that 
should. Meantime, let me say, 
forjour satisfaction, thatlknow 
not that I have any thing criminal 
or disreputable to ant — '—

from me, but by my previoos con- 
sent. 

These communicatious you 
must not, my good Mrs. Norton, 
look upon as appeals against my 
relations. On tbe contrary, I am 
heartily sorry, that thev have in- 
curred the (lispleaBiire of so excel- 
lent a divine as Dr. Lewen. Hut 
TOO desire to have every thiug 
Wore you: and, I think you 
ought: for who knows, as you Bay, 
bat you may be apphed to at last 
to administer comfort from their 
conceding heartn, to one that 
wants it: and wbo, sometimes, 
judging by what she knows of 
hei own heart, thinka herself en- 
titled to it, 

I know that I have a most in- 
dulgent and sweet-tempered mo- 
ther; but having to deal with vio- 
lent spirits, she has too often for- 
feited that peace of mind which 
she so much prefers , hy her over 
concern to preserve it. 

I am sure ehe would not have 
turned me over for an answer to a 
letter written with so contrite and 
fervent a spirit, as was mine to 
her, to amiwcu/iiiespirit, had she 
been left to herself. 

Bat, my dear Mrs. Norton, 
might not, think you, the revered 
!»oy have favoured me with one

THE mSTORY OP 



give you my reasons for taking 
it* 

It must be expected , that situa- 
tions uncommonly difficult, will 
make necessary some extraordi- 
nary steps , which , but for those 
situations, would be hardly ex- 
cusable. It will be very happy 
indeed, and somewhat wonderful, 
if all the measures I have been 
driven to take should be right. A 
pure intention , void of all unduti- 
ful resentment, is what must be 
my consolation, whatever others 
may think of those measures, when 
they come to know them: which 
however, will hardly be, till it is 
out of my power to justify them, 
or to answer for myself. 

I am fflad to hear of my cousin 
Mordens safe arrival. I should 
wish to see him methinks ; but I 
am afraid, that he will sail with the 
stream, as it must be expected 
that he will hear what they have 
to say first. — But what 1 most 
fear, is, that he will take upon 
himself to avenge me — rather 
than he should do so, I would 
have him look upon me as a 
creature utterly unworthy his 
concern; at least of his vindictive 
concern. 

How soothing to the wounded 
heart of your Clarissa, how balmy, 
are the assurances of your con- 
tinued love and favour; — love 
me, my dear mamma Norton, con- 
tinue to love me , to the end ! — I 
now think that I may, without 
presumption, promise to deserve 
your love to the end. And when 

* She means that of making Mr. Bel- 
ford her executor. 



I am gone , cherish my memory in 
your worthy heart ; for in so doing 
you will cherish the memory of 
one who loves and honours you 
more than she can express. 

But when I am no more, get 
over, I charge you, as soon as you 
can, the smarting pangs of grief 
that will attend a recent loss; and 
let all be early turned into that 
sweetly melancholy regard to 
MEMORY, which, engagmg us to 
forget all faults, and to remember 
nothing but what was thought 
amiable, gives more pleasure than 
pain to survivors — especially if 
they can comfort themselves with 
the humble hope , that the divine 
mercy has taken the dear departed 
to itself. 

And what is the space of time to 
look backward upon , between an 
early departure, and the longest 
survivance ! — And what the con- 
solation attending the sweet hope 
of meeting again, never more to 
be separated, never more to be 
pained, grieved, or aspersed; but 
mutually blessing, and being 
blessed, to all eternity? 

In the contemplation of this 
happy state, in which I hope, in 
God's good time, to rejoice with 
you, my beloved Mrs. Norton, and 
also with my dear relations, all 
reconciled to, and blessing the 
child against whom they are now 
so much incensed , I conclude my- 
self 

Your ever dutiful and 

affectionate

as villhout her. 

How then can the fall of such a 
one create a proper distress, when 
all the circumstances of it are con- 
sidered? Fordoes she not brazen 
out her crime, even after detec- 
tion? Knowing her owu guilt, she 
calls for Altamont's vengeance on

trary, to find reason to justify 
them at her own expense; and 
seetns more conceniw for their 
cruelty to her for their sakea here- 
after, when sbe shall be uo more, 
than for her own : for, as to her-

forgive her, though no one on 
earth will. 

On every estraordinary provo- 
cation she baa recourse to the 
scriptures, and endeavours to re- 
gulate her vehemence by sacred 
precedents. "Betterpeople, she 
says, have been more afllicted 
tlinn she, grievous as she some- 
times thinks her afflictions: and

occasion I have mentioned (some 
new instances of impUcablenesa 
from her friends) the inclosed me- 
ditation will shew, how mildly, 
and yet how forcibly abe com- 
plains. Seeif thou, in the wicked 
levity of thy heart, canst apply it

THE mSTOEY OP 



Be it indeed that I have erred, my 
error remaineth with myself. 

To her that is affUcted^pity should 
he shewn from her friends. 

But she that is ready to slip with 
her feet, is as a lamp despised in the 
thought of them that are at ease. 

There is a shame which hringeth 
sin, and there is a shame which 
hringeth glory and grace. 

Have pity upon me, have pity upon 
me, O ye my friends! for the hand 
of God hath touched me. 

If your soul were in my sours 
stead, I also could speak as ye do : 
I could heap up words against 
you 

But I would strengthen you with 
my mouth, and the moving of my lips 
should assuage your grief. 

Why will ye hreak a leaf driven 
to and frof Why will ye pursue 
the dry stuhhle f Why will ye write 
hitter words against me, and make 
me possess the iniquities of my youth ? 

Mercy is seasonable in the time of 
affliction, as clouds of rain in the 
time of drought. 

Are not my days few ? Cease then, 
and let me alone, that I may take 
comfort a little — before I go whence 
1 shall not return; even to the land 
of darkness, and shadow of death I 

Let me add , that the excellent 
lady is informed , by a letter from 
Mrs. Norton, that Colonel Morden 
is just arrived in England. He is 
now the only person she wishes to 
see. 

I expressed some jealousy upon 

it, lest he should have place given 

/jver mom the executorship. She 

jTifltZr/. that she iiad no thouglits to 



do so now; because such a trust, 
were he to accept of it (which she 
doubted) might, from the nature 
of some of the papers , which in 
that case would necessarily pass 
through his hands, occasion mis- 
chief between my friend and him, 
that would be worse than death 
for her to think of. 

Poor Belton I hear is at death's 
door. A messeneer is just come 
from him , who tens me , he cannot 
die till he sees me. I hope the 
poor fellow will not go off yet: 
since neither his affairs in this 
world, nor for the other are in 
tolerable order. I cannot avoid 
going to the poor man. Yet am 
unwilling to stir, till I have an as- 
surance from you, that you will 
not disturb the lady : for I know 
he will be very loth to part with 
me, when he gets me to him. 

Tourville tells me how fast thou 
mendest: let me conjure thee not 
to think of molesting this incom- 
parable woman. For thy own 
sake I request this as well as for 
hers, and for the sake of thy given 
promise : for should she die within 
a few weeks , as I fear she will , it 
will be said, and perhaps too 
justly , that thy visit has hastened 
her end. 

In hopes thou wilt not, I wish 
thy perfect recovery: else that 
thou mayst relapse, and be con- 
fined to thy bed.

tbrbear the thoughts of any further ,

What an unmerciful fuUow art

liowe wrote a play that answers 
not his title, am 1 to be reflected

1 repent; I would repair — she 
forgives my sins; she accepts my 
repentance; but she wou't let me

me to do? 

But get thee gone to Beiton, rb

thou goest or not, up I munf go, 
and see what I can do with t<ie 
sweet oddity myself The moment

Colonel Morden, thou Iiast

has Imd his ^rU, as well &s you

or secretly, who has not? The 
deril always baits with a pretty 
wench, when he angles for a man,

it will. 

I have often heard my beloved

iBtinction and esteem. I wish 
he conld make matters a little 
easier, for her mind's sake, be-

Methinka I am sorry for honest 
Belton. But a man cannot be ill, 
or vapourish, but thou lifteat up 
thy shriefc-owl note, and killest

fellow, who ia fit for a dnimmei' 
in death's forlorn-hope, could 
take so much delight, aa thou dost, 
in beating a dead march with thy 
goose -quills. 

Whereas, didst thou but know 
thine own talents, thou art formed 
to give mirth by thy Tery appear-

on thy friendship wiiare Miss Mar- 
lowe's humoar was concerned. 

I had no other pltLce so ready, 
and so was forced to go to my old 
lodginga, where hIbo my ward- 
robe is; and there I poured out 
nuUionB of ciiraes upon the whole 
crew, and refused to see cither 
Sally or Folly; and this not only 
for suffering the ladj to eseape, 
bat for the vitlainous arrest, and 
for then? detestable insolence to 
her at the officer's house. 

I dressed myself in a aever-wom 
anit, which I had intended for one 
of my wedding suita; and liked 
m^eelf bo well, that 1 began to 
think with thee that my outside 
was the best of me.

rushed my honour; the woman be- 
hind the compter all io flutters; 
respect and fear giving due so- 
lemnity to her featorea; and her 
knees, 1 doubt not, knocking 
against the inside of her wainscot 

Your servant, madam — Will, 
let the fellows move to some dis- 
tance, and wait. 

You have a young lady lodges 
here; Miss Harlowe, madam: is 
she above? 

Sir, sir, an' please your hononr

I shall find her apartment. And 
was making towards the stairs. 

Sir, sir, the lady, the lady is 
not at home— she is abroad — she 

In the country! not at home! — 
Impossible. You will not pass 
this story uponme, good woman. 
' I iiivsl see her. 1 have business of

Indeed, sir, the lady is not at

She then rung a bell; John, 
cried ahe, pray step down! — In-

oftbehouse, when I expected one 
of hia journeymen, by her saney

110 



THE HISTORY OP 



My dear, said she, the gen- 
tleman will not believe Miss Har- 
lowe is abroad. 

John bowed to my fine clothes: 
Your servant, sir — indeed the 
lady is abroad. She went out of 
town this morning by six o'clock 
— into the country — By the doc- 
tor's advice. 

Still I would not believe either 
John or his wife. I am sure , said 
I , she cannot be abroad , I heard 
she was very ill — she is not able 
to go out in a coach. Do you know 
Mr.Belford, friend? 

Yes, sir; I have the honour to 
know 'Squire Belford. He is gone 
into the country to visit a sick 
friend; he went on Saturday, 
sir. 

This had also been told from 
thy lodgings to Will , whom I sent 
to desire to see thee on my first 
coming to town. 

WeU, and Mr. Belford wrote 
me word that she was exceeding 
ill. How then can she be gone 
out? 

O, sir, she is very ill; very ill, 
indeed — she could hardly walk 
to the coach. 

Belford, thought I, himself 
knew nothing of the time of my 
coming: neither can he have re- 
ceived my letter of yesterday: and 
so ill, 'tis impossible she should 
go out. 

Where is her servant? Caliber 
servant to me. 

Her servant, sir, is her nurse: 
she has no other. And sJie is gone 
with her. 

Well, friend, I must not be- 
lieve you. You'll excuse me ; but 



I must go up stairs myself. And 
was stepping up. 

John hereupon put on a serious, 
and a less respectful face — Sir, 
this house is mine ; and — 

And what, friend? not doubt- 
ing then but she was above. I 
must and will see her. I have 
authority for it. I am a justice of 
peace. I have a search-warrant. 

And up I went ; they following 
me, muttering, and in a plaguy 
flutter. 

The first door I came too was 
locked. I tapped at it 

The lady, sir, has the key of 
her own apartment. 

On the inside I question not, 
my honest friend ; tapping again. 
And being assured, if she heard 
my voice , that her timorous and 
soft temper would make her betray 
herself by some flutters, to my 
listening ear, I said aloud, I am 
confident Miss Harlowe is here: 
dearest madam, open the door: 
admit me, but for one moment to 
your presence. 

But neither answer nor flutter- 
ing saluted my ear; and the people 
bemg very quiet, I led on to the 
nextapartment; and thekeybeinff 
on the outside, I opened it, and 
looked all round it, and into the 
closet. 

The man said he never saw so 
uncivil a gentleman in his life. 

Hark thee, friend, said I; let 
me advise thee to be a little de- 
cent ; or I shall teach thee a les- 
son thou never leamedst in all thy 
life. 

Sir, said he , 'tis not like a gen- 



EmHn, to aScpnt b. man in his 
■a honse. 
Then pr'ythee man, replied I, 
n't CTOw upon thine ana dung- 



Ill 



HAllLOWB, 

I can guess, sir. 

Whomdoyoueuesame tobe? 

Your name ia Mr. Lovelace , sir, 
I make no doubt. 

The very aamfl. But how came 
you to guess bo well, dame Smith! 
You never saw me before — did 



PIT break it open ; — pushing hard 
Bgainstit, that it cracked aguin. 

The man looked pale; and 
trembling with bis fright, madea 
l>lagtiy long face; and called to 
one of hia Eoddice-makerB above, 
Joseph, come di>u>n quickly. 

Joseph came down, a lion's- 
fftce grinning fellow; thick and 
short, and bushy-headed like an 
old oak-pollard. Then did master 
John put on a sturdier look. But 
J only hummed a tane , traversed 
allthe other apartments, sounded 
the paaaages with myknucklea, to 
find whether there were private 
doors, and walked up the next 

Stur of stairs singing all the nay ; 
ohn and Joseph, and Mrs. Smitn, 
following me trembling. 

I looked round me there, and 
went into two open-door bed- 
ebambers; searched the closets, 
Uiepatsages, and peeped through 
the c^~hole of another; No Miss 
H&rlowe, by Jupiter! WhatshuU 
I do 1 ~ What shall I do ! as the 
nrls say.— No w will she be grieved 
Utat she is out of the way. 

1 said this on purpose to find 
oat whether these people knew the 
lady's story; and had the anewer 
I Mpeeted from Mrs. Smith — I 
believe n6t, sir. 

Why BO, Mrs. Smith? Do you 
JmcivirliQlam? 



compliment, andmissedit. 

"lis easy to guess, sir; for 
there cannot be two such gen- 
tlemen as you. 

Well said, dame Smith— but 
mean you ijtmd or bad? — Hand- 
some was the least 1 thought she 
would have said. 

Heave you to guess, sir- 
Condemned, thought 1, by my- 
self, ott this appeal. 
Why, father Smith, thy wife is 

awit, man? Did'st thou ever 

find that out before? — But where 
is widow Lovick, dame Smith? 
!Vly cousin John Belford says she 
is a very good woman. Is she 
within? Or is she gone with Miea 
Harlowe too? 

She will be within by-and-by, 
sir. She is not with the lady. 

Well, but ray good, dear Mrs. 
Smith , whither is the lady gone? 
And when will she retnm? 



I CI 



'ttell. 



Don't tell fibs, dame Smith; 
don't tell fibs , chucking her under 
the chin : which made John's upper 
lip, with chin shortened, rise to 
his nose. — I am sure j'ouknowl 
— Buthere'aanotherpau: of stairs: 
let us see ; who lives up there? But 
hold, here's another room locked 
up , tapping at the door — Who's 
at home? cried I. 



112 



THJB HISTORY OF 



That's Mrs.LoTick's apartment, 
she is gone out, and has the key 
with her. 

Widow Lovick ! tapping again, 
I believe you are at home: pray 
open the door. 

John and Joseph muttered and 
whispered together. 

No whispering, honest friends: 
'tis not manners to whisper. Jo- 
seph, what said John to thee? 

John, sir ! disdainfully repeated 
the good woman. 

I beg pardon, Mrs. Smith: but 
you see the force of example. Had 
you shewed your honest man more 
respect, / should. Let me give 
you a piece of advice — Women 
who treat their husbands irreve- 
rently, teach strangers to use 
them with contempt. There, 
honest master John ; why dost not 
pull off thy hat to me? — 0, so 
thou wouldst, if thou hadst it on: 
but thou never wearest thy hat in 
thy wife's presence, I oelieve; 
dost thou? 

None of your fleers and your 
jeersj sir, cried John, I wish every 
married pair lived as happily as 
we do. • 

I wish so too, honest friend. 
But I'll be hanged if thou hast any 
children. 

Why so, sir? 

Hast thou? — Answer me, man? 
Hast thou, or not? 

Perhaps not, sir. But what of 
that? 

What of that? — Why I'll tell 
thee: the man who has no children 
by his wife, must put up with plain 
John. Hadst thou a child or two, 
thou'dst be called Mr. Smith, with 



a curtsey, or a smile at leaat, at 
every word. 

You are very pleasant, sir, re- 
plied my dame. I fancy, if either 
my husband or I had as much to 
answer for as I know whom, we 
should not be so merry. 

Why then, dame Smith, so 
much the worse for those who 
were obliged to keep you com- 
pany. But I am not memr — I 
am sad! — Hey ho! — Where 
shall I find my dear Miss Har- 
lowe? 

My beloved Miss Harlowe I [call- 
ing at the foot of the third pair of 
stairs] if you are above, for 
Heaven's sake answer me. I am 
coming up. 

Sir, said the good man, I wish 
you'd walk down. The servants' 
rooms, and the working rooms, 
are up those stairs, and another 
pair ; and nobody's there that you 
want. 

Shall I go up and see if Miss 
Harlowe be there, Mrs. Smith? 

You may, sir, if you please. 

Then I won't go ; for, if she was, 
you would not be so obliging. 

I am ashamed to give you all 
this attendance: you are the poli- 
test traders I ever knew. Honest 
Joseph, slapping him upon the 
shoulder on a sudden, which made 
him jump, didst ever ^rin for a 
wager, man? For me rascal 
seemed not displeased with me; 
and, cracking his flat face from 
ear to ear, with a distended mouth, 
shewed his teeth, as broad and as 
black as his thumb nails. — But 
don't I hinder thee ? What canst 
earn a day, man? 



^L- Haifa crOTTii, I can earn a day! 
^Miith an &ir of pride and petulance, 
^Bt being startled. 
^K There, then, is a day's wages 
Hvir tliee. But thou needeat not 
^^«ttend me farther. 

Come, Mrs. Smith, come John, 
(Master Smitb, 1 should say) let's 
walk dotra, and give me an ac- 
eoout where the Indy ia gone, and 
when she will return. 

So down stairs led I John and 
Joseph (tbough I had discharged 
the latter) and my dame following 
me, to shew their complaianuce to 
ft stranger. 

1 re-entered one of the first 
floor rooma, I have a great mind 
to be your lodger : for Inever saw 
Btich obliging folks in my life. 
What rooms EaTe you to let? 

None at all, sir. 

I am sorry for that. But whose 
isthia? 

Mine, sir, chuflilv said John. 

T^ine, man? Whythenlwill 
take it of thee. This, and a bed- 
chamber, and a garret for one ser- 
Tftnt, will content me. 1 will give 
thee thine own price, and half-a 
guinea a day over, for those" " 



CIiAElSSA HAra.OWE. 



For ten guineas a day, 

Hold, John', (master Smith I|back3 
should say) — Before thou speak- with each 
ert, consider — I won't be af- 
fronted, 



113 

Well, then, I am glad I pre. 
vented you; for such words better 
become my mouth than yours. 
But I must lodge with you till the 
lady returns. I believe 1 must. 
However, you may be wanted in 
the shop; BO we'U talk that over 

Down I went, they paying dili ■ 
gent attendance on my steps. 

When I came into the shop, 

eiug no chair or stool, I went 
behind the compterj and sat down 
under an arched kmd of canopy 
of carved work, which these proud 
traders, emnlatine the royal niehe- 
fiUerSjOfteo give ULCmselvea, while 
a joint-stool, perhaps, serves thoEe 
by whom they get their bread: 
such is the dignily of trade in this 
mercantile naljon! 

1 looked about me, and above 
me, and told them, I was very 
proud of my seat; askinc, if John 
were ever permitted to fill this su- 
perb niche? 

Perhaps he was, he said, very 
surlily. 

That is it, that makes thee look

a purse-mo utb, as it'ehe would not

glass, and gave Will sii. There

He did, gcinning with bia teeth 
oat before; which touching my 
coa9ctence,!iB the loss of them was 
owing to me; Joseph, said l,come 
hither. Come hither, man, when 
I bid thee. 

He stalked towards me, his 
hands behiud hitn, half willing, 
and half unwilling. 

I suddenly wrapped my arm 
round his neck. Will, thy pen- 
knife, this moment. D — n the fel- 
low, Where's thy penknife?

while my other hand was mu;i/ling 
about bis cursed chaps, as if 1 
would take his teeth out, 

I will pay thee a good price, 
man: don't struggle thus! the 
penknife. Will! 

OLord, cried Joseph, struggling 
still more and more. And out 
comes Will's prmiing knife; for 
the rascal is a gardener in the 
conntry. I have only this, sir. 

The best in the world to lance a 
gum, D — n the fellow, why dost

tragi- comical, I let him go. 

I only wanted, said 1, to take 
out two or three of this raaeal^: 
broad teeth, to put them into my 
servant's jaws — and I would have 
paid him his price for them. '' 
would, by my aoul, Joseph. 

Joseph shook his ears ; and wilk' 
both hands streaked down, amootfa, 
as it would lie, his busby baiij 
and looked at me, as if he knew 
not whether be should lau^h or hi 
angry: but, after a stupid staro^ 
or two, stalked off to the otiiei

THE HISTORY OF 



now I hope you will buy some- 
thing for yourself. Nobody shall 
use you better, nor sell you 
cheaper. 

Come, said she, give me six- 
penny worth of Portugal snuff . 

They shewed me where it was, 
and I served her : and said, when 
she would have paid me, I took 
nothing at my opening. | 

If I treated her footman, she 
told me, I should not treat her. 

Well, with all my heart, said I : 
'tis not for us tradesmen to be 
saucy — is it, Mrs. Smith? 

I put her six -pence in my 
pocket; and seizing her hand, 
took notice to her of the crowd 
that had gathered about the door, 
and besought her to walk into the 
back-shop with me. 

She struggled her hand out of 
mine, and would stay no longer. 

I bowed, and bid her kindly 
welcome, and thanked her, and 
hoped I should have her custom 
another time. 

She went away smiling; and 
Andrew after her; who made me 
a fine bow. 

I began to be out of coun- 
tenance at the crowd, which 
thickened apace; and bid Will 
order the chair to the door. 

Well, Mrs. Smith, with a grave 
air, I am heartily sorry Miss Har- 
lowe is abroad. You don't tell me 
where she is? 

Indeed, sir, I cannot. 

You will not , you mean. — She 
could have no notion of my 
coming. I came to town but last 
night. I have been very ill. She 
has almost broken my heart by 



her cruelty. You know my story, 
I doubt not. Tell her, I must go 
out of town to-morrow morning. 
But I will send my servant, to 
know if she will favour me with 
one half -hour's conversation; for 
as soon as I get down, I shall set 
out for Dover, in my way to 
France, if I have not a counter- 
mand ^om her who has the sole 
disposal of my fate. 

And so, flinging down a Portu- 
gal Six-and- thirty, I took Mr. 
Smith by the hand, telling him, I 
was sorry we had not more time to 
be better acquainted: and bidding 
farewell to honest Joseph (who 
pursed up his mouth as I passed 
b^ him, as if he thought his teeth 
still in jeopardy) and Mrs. Smith 
adieu, and to recommend me to 
her fair lodger, hummed an ur, 
and the chair being come , whipt 
into it; the people about the door 
seeming to be in good humour 
with me; one crying, A pleasant 
gentleman, I warrant him I And 
away I was carried to White's ac- 
cording to direction. 

As soon as I came thither, I 
ordered Will to go and chazige 
his clothes , and to disguise him- 
self by putting on his black wig, 
and keeping his mouth shut; and 
then to dodge about Smith's, to 
inform himself of the lady's mo- 
tions. 

« « « 

I QivE thee this impudent Re- 
count of myself, that tnou mayeat 
rave at me, and call me hardened, 
and what thou wilt. For, in the 
first place, I, who had been so 
lately ill, was glad I was alive; 



and then I iras so balbcil by my 
eharmer'a nneipected absence, 
aad so ruffled by th&t., And br the 
bhiff trefttmeut of father John, 
that I bad no other way to avoid 
being out of humour with all I met 
with. Moreover, I waa rejoiced to ' 
find, by the lady's absence, and 
by ner going oat at six in the 
morning, tbAt it was impossible 
she shonld be so ill as thou repre- 
sentest her to be; and this gave 
me Btill higher spirits. Then I 
know the sex always love cheerful 
and bumourouB fellows. The dear 
isreatiu'e herself used to bepleased 
with my gay temper and lively 
manner; and had she been told, 
that I was blubbering for her in 
the back'shop, she would have 
' ' still more than she 



Furthermore, I was sensible, 
that the people of the houee mast 
needs have a terrible notion of me, 
as a savage , bloody-minded , ob- 
durate fellow; a perfect woman- 
eater; and, no doubt, expected to 
see me with the claws of a lion, 
and the fangs of a tiger; and it 
waa bat policy to shew them, what 
a harmless pleasaut fellow 1 am 
in order to familiarize the John' 
and the Joseph's tome, Foritwa 
'evident to me, by the good wo 
man's calling them down, that 
■he thought ne a dangerous man. 
Whereas now, John and I have 
ihaken hands together, and daiae 
Smith having seen that I have the 
fkee, and hands, and looks of a 
man, and walk uprieht,and prate, 
Ud Utigh, and joke, like other 
yeople; and Joseph, that I can

talk of taking his teeth out of his 
head, without doiug him the least 
hurt; they will all, at my next 
visit, be much more easy and plea- 
sant with me than Andrew's cloves 
were to him; and we shall ne as 
thoroughly acquainted, as if we 
had known one another a twelve- 
month. 

When I returned to our mo- 
ther's, I again cursed her, and all 
our nymphs together, and still re- 
fused to see either Sally or Polly. 
I raved at the horrid arrest; and 
told the old draeou, that it was 
lowing to her and hers, that the 
ifairest virtue in the world was 
ruined; my reputation for ever 
blasted; and that I was not mar- 
ried , and happy in the love of the 
most excellent of ber sex. 

She, to pacify me. said, she 
would shew me a n 
would please me; si 
not see Sally who v 
grief. 

Where is this new face? cried 
I: let me see her, though I shall 
never see any face with pleasure 
but Miss Harlowe's. 

She won't come down, replied 
she. She will not be at the word 
of command yet. She is but just 
in the trammels; and must be 
waited upon, I'll assure you; and 
courted much besides. 

Aye! said 1, that looks well. 
Lead me to her the instant. 

1 followed her up: and who 
should she be , but that little toad

hive heard my story. You are i 
admirer of the most excellent 
vomaa in the world. Dear Mia. 
Lovick, tell me what is become of 
her? 

The poor lady, sir, went out 
yesterday, on purpose to avoid 

How so? She knew not that I 
would be here. 

She was aJTsid you would come 
when she heard you wore re- 
covered from your illness. Ah ! sir, 
what pity if ia that bo fine agen*

if she will have it ao, Iwill never

death for her to see you. She was 
at home last nigbt^ I'll tell yoa

die; and if she could not a^oid 
your visit, she was uuable to ily

Why, sir, she rested not two 
hours , for fear of you. Her fear 
gave her strength, which she'll 
suffer for, when that fear is over. 
And finding herself, the more she 
thought of your visit, the less able 
to stay to receiveit, she took chair, 
and is gone nobody knows whither. 
Hut, 1 believe , she intended to be 
carried to the water-side, in order 
to take boat; for she cannot bear 
acoach. It eitremelj incommoded 
her yesterday. 

But before we talk any further, 
said I, ifshe be gone abroad, yon 
can have no objection to my look- 
ing into every apartment above 
and below; because I :un told she 
is actually m the house. 

Indeed, sir, she lis II nf. You may 
satisfy yourself, if you please; 
but Mrs. Smith and I waited on 
her to her chair. We were forced 
to support her, she was so weak. 
She said , Whither can I go , Mrs, 
Lovick? whither coii 1 go, Mrs. 
Smith? — Cruel, cruel man! — 
Tell him I called him so, if he 
come again! God give him that 
peace which be denies me ! 

Sweet creature! cried I, and 
looked down, and took out my 
handkerchief. 

The widow wept. I wish, i^ 
she, 1 had never known aoo^- 
leut a lady, and so gieaXiw^hmt 
I love her as my own cbildf 

Mrs. Smith wept

no si^na of an tmrnmil;/, but, con-

ease the overcharged heart, which 
would burst but for that kindly 
and natural relief. 



WbitperM iL a'gr-fraug!.l iean, o»il biii,

usedst to take pleasure in repeti- 
tions from the poets; but thon 
must be tasteless of their beauties 
uowi^etbo not diacomitenanced 
by this uncouth and unreflecting 
Mowbray, for, as Juvenal says, 
Tears are the prerogative ofman- 

'Tia, at least, seasonably said, 
my dear Belford. It is kind to 
keep ine in countenance for this 
leiimanish weakiiesx, as Mowbray 
has been upbraidingly calling it, 
ever since lie has been with me: 
and in so doiii^ (whatever I might 
have thought in such hi^h health 
as he enjoys) has convinced me, 
that bottle friends feel nothing 
but what moves in that little 

Well, well, uroeeed in your own 
way, Jack. I love my friend Bel- 
ton as well as you can do ; yet for 
the blood of me, I cannot but 
think, that soothing a man's 
weakness is incroaaing it 

If it be a weakness, to be 
touched at sreat and concerning 
eventa, in which our humanity is 
concerned, saidl, thoumayeatbe 
right.

more delight to talk of the living

the dying Belton and his repeD-

what will he then think of the

attention? Tell him, dearBelford, 
tell him, how happy he is, if he

still an opportunity lent him, for

■worlds, had I them to give ! " 

I approved exceedingly of his 
reflections, as suited to his present 
ciicumstances: and inferred con- 
solations to him from a mind so 
properly (ouched. 

He proceeded in the like peni- 
tent strain. I have lived a very 
wicked life: ao have weall. We 
have never made a conacience of 
doing whatever miachief either 
force or fraud enabled us to do.

are more than the effects of imagi-

I was called twice oo Sunday 
night to him; for the poor fellow, 
when his reflections on his past 
life annoy him most, is a&aid of 
being left with the woi 
his eyes, they IcU me, huatand 
roll about for me. Where's Mr.

out, cries he — yet begofhimto 
step to me — yet don't — yet do; 
were once the doubting and 
changeful orders he gave; and 
they called me accordingly. 

But. alas! what could Belfoid 
dofornim? Belford, who had been 
but too often the companion of his 
guilty hours; who wants merey 
as much as he does, and is unable 
to promise it to hintself, though 
'tis all he can bid his poor friend 
rely upon. 

What miscteantsarewe! What 
figures shall we make in t' 
terrible hours !

THB HIBTOEY OP 



Bclf in my compauy, for [the first 
partofthenight: Adrowningman 
wUl cateh at astraiB, the proverb 
well says: anil a straw was I, with 
respect to any real help I could 
give him. He often awaked in 
terrors; and once calling out for 
me, Dear Belford, said he, where 
are you? — Oh! there you ai-e! — 
Give me your friendly handl — 
Then grasping it, and patting his 
clainmy,half coldlips toit — How 
kind! — I fear every thing when 
you a^e absent. But the presence 
ofafriend, a sympathising friend 

— oh ! how comfortable ! 

But about four in the morning 
he frighted me much: he waked 
with fliree terrible groans; and 
endeavoured to speak, but could 
not presently — and when he did, 

— Jack, Jack, Jack, five or sis 
times repeated he as quick as 
thought, now, now, now, save me, 
save me, save me — 1 am going — 
going, indeed! 

1 threw my arms about him, and 
raised bim up on his pillow, as he 
was sinking (as iftoliide himself) 
in the bed-clothes — and staring 
wildly, Where am I? said he, a 
little recoverins. Did you not see 
him? turning his head this way 
and that; horror in his counten- 
ance; Didyounot seehim? 

See whom, see what, my dear 
Helton! 

O lay me upon the bed again! 
cried he. — Let me not die upon 
the floor ! — Lay me down gently 
and stand hyme!— Leavemenot 

— All, all wilt soon be over! 
You are already, my dear 

Beltoa, upon the bed. You have 



not been upon the floor. This 
a Btroog delirium; you are faint 
for want of refreshment [for hehaii 
"refused several times to take . — 
Lhing]; let me persuade vou 
take some of this cordial julep, 
will leave you, if you will 

He then readily took it; bn 
said he could have sworn th 
Tom Metcalfe had been in tl 
room, and had draws him onti 
bed by the throat, upbraiding hi 
with the injuries heliad first doi 
his sister, and then him, in ti 
duel to which he owed that tef 
which cost him his life. 

Thou knoweet the story, Lova

more evident every hoar, Ujl

Mowbray, quite tired with tb

was not a little rejoiced to neaijri 



rWe i 



He has just taken leave of bii 
poor friend, intending to go aw&y 
ettrly: an everlasting leave,! maj 
venture to say; tor I think he 
will hardly live till t 
night, 

i believe the poor roan would 
not have been sorry had he U 
him when I arrived; for 'tis 
ehocking creature, and enjoys t< 
strong health to know how to pity 
the Bick. Then (to borrow an 
observation from thee) he has, by 
nature , strong bodily orgaus, 
wbicti those of his soul i 
likely to whet out; and he, 
as the wicked friend be is going 
to,inay last a great while from thi 
strength of their constitutions 
though 80 greatly different in their 
talents; if neither the aword 
the halter interpose. 

I mnst refieat , that I cannot but 
be very uneasy for the poor lady 
whom you eo cruelly persecute; 
and that I do not think you have 
kept your honour with me. I was 
apprehensive, indeed, tliat you 
would attempt to see her, as soon 
as you got well enough to come 
up; and 1 told her as much, mak- 



ing I 



i of it 



prepai;^ her for your visit , and to 
induce her to stand it. Bat she 
could DOt, it is ^lain, bear the 
shock of it: and mdeed she told 
me, that she would not see you, 
though but for one half-hour, for 
the world. 

Could she have prevailed upon 
hem^, I kaom that the sight of 



135 

her would have been as affecting 
to you, as your visit could have 
been to her; when you had seen 
to what a lovely skeleton (for she is 
really lovely still, nor can she, with 
suchaform and features, be other- 
wise) you have, in a few weeks, 
reduced one of the most charming 
women iu the world; and that in 
the fnll bloom of her youth and 
beauty. 

Mowbray undertakes to carry 
this, that he may be more welcome 
to yon, he says. Were it to be 
sent unsealed, the characters we 
would be Hebrew to the 
dunce. 1 desire you to return it; 
and I'll give you a copy of it upon 
demand; forlintend tokeepitby

f your c mp any , which might 
otherwise, perhaps, some time 
be apt to weaken the im-

I dispatcbed instantlj a letter 
to the dear creature , assuring lier, 
with the most thankful joy, '"fhat 
T would directly set out for Herks, 
and wait the issue of the happy 
reconciliation, and the charmiue 
hopes abe had filled me with. J 

5ou[ed out upon ber a thousand 
iesaings. 1 declared that it should 
be the study of my whole life to 
merit such transcendent goodness: 
and that there was nothing which 
her father or friends ahouldrequire 
at my hands, thatlwould not for 
heraaike comply with, in order to 
promote andcomplete sodesirable 
a reconciliation." 

I hurried it away without taking 
a copy of it; and 1 have ordered 
the chariot- and- six to be got 
ready; andhcy for M. Hall! Let 
me but know how Belton does. 1 
hope a letter from thee is on the 
road. And if the poor fellow can 
spare thee, make baste, I com- 
maud thee, to attend this truly 
divine lady. Thou may'st not else 
see her of months perhaps; at 
least not while she is Miss Hab- 
LoWE. And oblige me, ifpoBBible, 
with one letter before she sets out, 
confirming to me and accounting 
for this generous change. 

But what accounting for it 
necessary? The dear creature 
cannot receive consolation herself 
but she must commoiiioate it to 
others. How noble! She would 
not see me in her adversity; hot 
2IO Booaei doeu the suu of pro- 



sperity begin to shine Upon her, 
than sne forgives me. 

1 know to whose mediation all 
thia is owing. It is to Col. Mor-

loved and honoured him! And 
he loved her above all hia rela- 

I shall now be eonviiiced that 
there is something ia dreams. The 
opening cloud is the reconcilia- 
tion in view. The bright form, 
lifting up my charmer throngh it 
to a nrmament stuck round with 
golden cherubims and seraphiiOB,

of this happy reconciliation. Tha 
welcomes, tbnce lepeated, an- 
those of herfamily, tiownomon' 
to be deemed implacable. Yet lire-

Letme tell thee, Jack, that so 
much am 1 pleaded with this world 
in the main; though iDsomepoints 
too , the world (to make a person 
of it) has been a rascal to me; so 
delighted am I with the joys of 
youth ; with my worldly prospects 
as to fortune, and now, newly, 
with the charming hopes giveu 
me by my dear, thrice dear, and 
for ever dear Ci.a.BissA ! thatnere 
I even sure that nothing bad 
would come hereafter, 1 should be 
very loth (very much afraid, if 
thou wilt have it so) to lay down 
my life and them together; and 
yet, upon a call of honour,no man 
fears death less than myself. 

Butlhave not either inclination 
or leisure to weigh thy if arfen argu- 
ments, except m the I'll/, or, aa 
thou wouldest say, in the lump. 

If 1 return thy letters, let me 
have them again sometime hence, 
that is to say, when I am married, 
or when poor Belton is half for- 
gotten; or when time has enrolled 
the honest fellow among those 
whom we have to long lost, that 
we mayremember them with more 
pleasure than pain; and then I 

ay give them a serious perusal,

thou wilt into the subject.

l£nd, l»mtotii3kiikl!iee, that 
the dear creature has avoided my 
visit. Things are now in so good 
atr.iin that 1 must forgive tlieei 
else thou shouldst have heard 
more of this new instance of dis- 
loyalty to thy general. 

Thou art continually giving 
thyself high praise, byway of op- 
poiilian, aslmaysay, toothers: 
gently and artfully blaming Ihy sel f 
for qualities thou wouldst, at the 
same time, have to be thought, 
and which generally are thought, 
praiseworthy. 

Thus , in the airs thou assumest 
about thy servants, thou wouldst 
pass for a mighty humane mortal ;

quy) to help on a sorry plot, or to 
bring about a necessary eclair- 
cissement, to save the poet the 
trouble of thinking deeplj; for a 
butter way to wind up his bot- 

Of this 1 am persuaded (what- 
ever my jirocfiii' be to my own 
servants) that tliou wilt be bene- 
fited by my Miw^, when we come 
to controvert the point. For then 
I shall convince thee, that the tira- 
innlic as well as natural characte- 
ristics of a good servant ought to 
be fidelity, common sense, cheer- 
full obedience, and silent respect: 
that wit in liis station, except to 
his companioua, would be sau- 
cinesa : that he should never pre- 
sume to give his advice: that if 
he ventured to espostulate upon 
any unreasonable command, or 
such a one as appeared to bimto 
be so, he should do it with humi- 
lity and respect, and take a 
E roper season for it. But such

performances I have seen, ^ve,

As soon as I had seen Mowbray

poor Belton; whom I found in 
dreadful agonies, in which he 
awoke, aahe generally does. 

The doctor came iu presently 
after; and I was concerned at 
the scene that passed between 

It opened with the dying man's 
asking him, with melancholy 
earnestness, if nothing, if no- 
thing at all could be done for 
him? 

The doctor shook his bead, and 
told him, he doubted not. 

I eanniil die, said the poor man; 
I cannot f/iink of dying, I am ve^r 
deairoDs of living a little longer, if 
I coulil but be free from these 
horrible pains in my stomach and 
head. Can you give me no thing

Alas! sir, replied his phy'sici an,

I fear, I fear nothing in physic can 
help you. 

He was then out of all patience. 
What, then, is your art, sirl — I

whole twelvemonth, to be wrought 
upon at the pleanure of you people

regard physicians, whose art is to

Sir, continued he fiercely (and 
with more strength of voice, and 
coherence, than he had shewn for 
several hours before), if you give 
me over, I give you over. — The

what do ye do, when called in, 
but nurse our distempers, till from 
pigmiea you make giants of them?

The doctor was out of coun- 
tenance; but said, if we could 
make mortal men imvtorlal, and 
minilil. iiot, ali this might be just. 

I blamed the poor man; yet ex- 
cused him to the physician. To 
die, dear doctor, when, like my 
poor friend, we are so desirous of 
life, ia a melancholy thing. We 
are apt to hope too much, not con- 
sidering that the seeds of death 
are sown in us when we begin to 
liTe, and grow up, till, like ram- 
~iant weeds, they choke tiie tender 

lower of life; which declines in

and not , when the flower or plaij 
is withered at the root, and th 
weed in its full vigour, expect 
that the medical art will reBtt-^ 
the one, or destroy the othi 
when that other, as I hinted, h 
been rooting itself in the hal 
from the time of our birth. 

This speech, Bob, thon wilt ci

Thou art releaaed from insuffer-

thy repentance, expiate for 
offences, and mayest thou

no opjjortunity for repentancej, 
that this is a merciful earnest that 
thy penitence is accepted; and 
that thy long illness, and dreadful 
agonies, in the last stages of ' 
were thy only punishment. 



I wish, indeed, I hearlilij wish, 
we could have seenone ray of com- 
fort darting in upon his benighted 
miiid,befoTe he departed. But all, 
alas! to the very last gasp, was 
horror and confusion, ind my 
oiily fear arises from this, that, 
till within the fourlast dayaof his 
life, he could not be hrouKbt t« 
think he should 'die, though in a 
visible decline for months; and, 
in that presumption, was too little 
inclineatoset about a serious pre- 

Earation for a journey, which he 
oped he should not bo obliged to 
take ; and when he began to a]>- 
prehend that ho could not put it 
otf, his impatience, and terror, 
and apprehension, shewed too 
little of that reliance and resigna- 
tion, which afford the most com- 
fortable reflections to the frieiids 
of the dying, as well as to the 
ilying themselves. 

But we must leave poor Belton 
to that merey , of which we have 
all so much need; and, for my 
nvni part (doyou, Lovelace, and 
the rest of the fraternity, as ye 
will) I am rcsolvedlwill endeavour

heart would break as she 
came down stairs, and as she went 
through the shop into the coach, 
her nurse with, her, as you had 
informed me before: that she 
ordered the coachman (whom she 
hired for the day) to drive any 
whither, so itwas into the air: he 
accordingly drove her to Hamp- 
stead, ana thence to Highgate. 
There at the Bowling-green 
House she alighted , exti'emely ill, 
and having breakfasted, ordered 
the coachman to drive veryslowly 
any whither. He crept along to 
Mttswell Kill, and put up at a 
public house there; where she 
employed herself two hours in 
writing, though exceedingly weak 
and low; till the dinner she had 
ordered was brought in: she en- 
deavoured to eat, butcouldnot;

gone, she said. And then she 
wrote on for three hours more; 
after which, being heavy, she 
dozed a little in an elbow chair. 
When she awoke, she ordered 
the coachman to drive her very 
slowly to town, to the house of a 
friend of Mrs. Loviuk; whom, as 
agreed upon, she met there: but. 
being extremely ill, she would 
venture liome at a late hour, al- 
though she heard from the widow, 
thatyou had been there; and had 
reason to be shocked at your be- 
haviour. She said, she found 
there was no avoiding yon: she 
was apprehensive she should not 
live many hours, aud it was not 
impossible but the shock the sight 
of you must give her, would de- 
termine her fate in your pre- 

"She accordingly went home. - 
She heard the relation of your 
astonishing vagaries, with bands 
and eyes often lifted up; and 
with these words intermingled, 
Shocking creature! Incorrigible

to bear the thoughts of an mter-

took to her usual chair early in

the Temple -stairs, whither she 
had ordered her nurse before her, 
to get a pair of oars in readiuess 
(for her f'atieues the day before

and then she was rowed to

Eat in, and drank tea at a house 
er waterman recommended to 
her. She wrote there for an hour ; 
and returned to the Temple: and 
when she landed, made one of the 
watermen get her a chair, and so 
was earriea to the widow's friend, 
BB the nigbt before; where she 
again met the widow, who 
formed her, that you ' -^ ■- 
after her twice that day. 

"Mrs. Lovick gave her there 
her siater'a letter*; and ihe was 
BO much affected with the con- 
tenta of it, that she was twice 
Tery nigh fainting away; and 
wept bitterly, as Mrs. Lovicki 
told Mrs. Smith; dropping some 
warmer expreEsions tban ever 
they had heard proceed from her 
lipfl, ia relation to her friends; 
calling them cruel, and complain- 
ing ot ill offlocs done her, and of 
vile reports raised against her. 

" Wnile she was thua disturbed, 
Mrs. Smith came to her , and told 
her, that you had been there a| 
third time, and was just gone, (at| 
half an hour after nine) having left 
word how civil and respectfitl you I 
would be; but that you was deter- ! 
mined to see her at all events. 

"She said, it was hard she 
could not be permitted to die in 
peace: that her lot was a severe 
one: that she began to be afraid 
she should not forbear repining, 
and to think her punishment 



greater than her fault: but re- 
calling herself immediately, she 
comforted herself that her life 
would be short, and with the as- 
surance of a better." 

By what 1 have mentioned, yon 
will conclnde with me, that the 
letter brought her by Sbs. Lovick 
(the superscription of which you 
saw to ce written in her Bister's 
bund) could not be the letter on 
the contents ofwhichehegrounded 
(Aufshe wrote to you, ouEerretum

Lovick, nor Mrs. Smith, nor the 
servant of the latter, know of any

women assured me, that she actu-

of a suspicion which I had began 
to entertaiu, that you (for some 
purpose I could not guess at) had 
forged the letter from her of which 
you sent me a copy. 

On Wednesday morning, wbcm 
she received your letter in answer 
to hers, she said, Necessity may 
well be called the mother of in- 
vention — but calamity is the test 
of integrity. — I hope I have not 
taken an ineicusable step — and 
there she stopt a minute or two; 
and then said, 1 shall no w, perhaps, 
be allowed to die in peace.

hope that any thing serious or

We had some talk about Bel- 
ton's dying behaviour, and I gave 
her several patticulara of the poor 
man's impatience and deapair; to 
which Bhewasvoryattcntive; and 
made fine obsei'vations upon the 
Bubjeet of procrastination. 

A letter and packet were 
brought her by a man on horse- 
back from Misa IIowc, while we 
were talking. She retired up 
stairs to read it ; and while I was 
in diacourse with Iilrs. Smith and 
Mrs. Lovick , the doctor and apo- 
thecary both came in together. 
They confirmed to me my fears, 
as to the dangerous way she is in. 
They had both been apprised of 
the new instances of implacable- 
ness in her friends, and of your 

Eersecutions : and the doctorsaid, 
e would not for the world be 
either the unforgiving father of 
that lady, or the man who had 
brought her to this distresa. Her

there is no saving her. But how, 
were 1 either the one or the other 
of the people 1 have named, I 
should Bupport myself afterwards 
I cannot tell. 

When she was told we were all 
three together, she desired us to

walk up. She 

three generalqueBtions relating 
her health, she addressed herself 
to ua, to the following effect: 

As I maj not , said she, see you 
three gentlemen together again, 
let me take this opportunity to 
acknowledge my obligations to 
youall. I am inexpresBibly obliged 
to you, sir, and to you, air, [conrt- 
seying to the doctor and to Mr. 
Goddard], for your fnitre than 
friendly, yoai jiatemid tare and 
concern for me. Hamanity in 
your profession , I daresay, is far 
from being a rare iiualification, 
because you are gentlemen E^ your 
profsBsioD: but so much kindness, 
BO much humanity, did never 
desolate creature meetwith, asl 
have met withfromyonbotb. But, 
indeed, I have always observed, 
that where a person relies upon 
ProvidencCj it never fails to raise 
up a new fnend for every old one 
that falls off. 

This gentleman [bowing to me] 
who, Bome people think, should 
have been one of the last 1 should 
have thought of for my eseeutor 
— is nevertheless (such is the 
strange turn that things have 
taken!) the only one I can choose; 
and therefore I have chosen him 
for that charitable office, and he 
has been so good as Co accept of it: 
for, rich asl may boast myself to 
be, I am rather so in liijJit, than in 
fad, at this present. I repeat 
therefore my numble thanks to 
you all three, and beg of God to

to each] an hundredfold, the kind- 
ness and favour you have shewn 
me; and that it may be in the 
power of youaudofyours, to the 
end of time, to confer benefits, 
rather than to be obliged toreceie* 
them. This ia a godlike power, 
gentlemen: I once rejoiced in itin 
some little degree; and much more 
in the prospect I had of its being 
enlarged to me; though I have 
had the mortification to experience 
the reverse, and to be obliged 
almost to every body I have seen 



bear the punishment without 
repining: and I hope I do. — Por-

wishes for, to express itself suit-

ness to me; and Ood Almigh^

She retired from us to her closet 
with her eyes full; and left lU 
looking upon one another. 

Wenad hardly recovered ow- 
sclveB,wheD she, quite easy.cbeer- 
ful, and smiling, returned to no.

They both hesitated, and looked 
upon each other. Don't be afraid 
to answer me, said she, each sweet 
hand pressing upon the arm of 
each gentleman , with that mingled

She then retired, witha cheerful

Tbus, Lovelace, it is plain, that 
she means to bespeak ber last

here's tranqnilhty of heart, on the 
most affecting occasion! — This 
is magnanimity indeed 1 — Couldst 
thou, or could I, with all oar 
boisterous bravery, and offensive 
false courage, act thus? — Poor 
Bekon, bow unlike was thy be-

Mrs. Lovick tells me, that the 

lady spoke of a letter she had 

received from her favourite divine 

Dr. Lewin, in the time of my ah- 

id of an answer she had 

returned to it. But Mrs. Lovick 

knows not the contents of either.

And let me add anollicr con- 
sideration: the prevention, by this 
means, of the miscliiefa that may 
otherwise happen between your 
brother and Mr. Lovelace, or be- 
tween the latter and your cousin 
Morden, who is now, I hear, ar- 
rived, and resolves to have justice 
done you. 

A consideration which ought to 
affect your conscience [forgiveme, 
deareat young lady, I think I am 
now in too way of my duty] ; and 
tobeof more concern to you, than 
that hard pressure upon your 
modesty which I know the ap- 
pearance against him in an open 
coartmuatbeof to such a lady as 
you; and which, I conceive, will 
be your great diffictdty. But I 
know, madam, that you have 
dignity enough to become the 
blushes of the most naked truth, 
when necessity, justice, and ho- 
nour, eiact it from you. Rakes 
and ravishers would meet with 
encouragement indeed, and most 
from those who had the greatest 
abhorrence of their actions, if 
violated modesty were never to 
complain of the injury it received 
fromthevillainDuaatteropteraofit, 

In a word, the reparation of your 
family disbonoui' now rests in your 
own bosom: and which only one 
of these two alternatives can re- 
pair; to wit, either to many the 
offender, or to prosecute liim at 
law. Bitter expedients for a soul 
so delicate as yoursl 

He and nil hia friends, I under- 
stand, solicit you to the firat: and 
it Is certainly, now, all the amends 
within his power to make. But I

(Aetr BolicitatioDB, acdftis, with the 
indignation and contempt that his 
vilf) actions have deserved: but 
jet, that jou refuse not to eitend 
to him the christian forgiveneaahf

disturbance from sovileamolester 
depend upon hia eourtesy: Ishould 
think so noble and bo rightlj- 
guided a spirit as yours, would 
not permit that it should, if ^ou 
could help it. 

And can indignities of any kind 
Ije properly pardoned till we have 
it in imr power to punish them 
To pretend to pardon, while wi 
are labouring under the pain o. 
dishonour of them, will he thought 
by some to be but the vaunted 
mercy of a pusillanimous heart, 
trembling to resent them. The

however injured and oppressed, 
remains unshaken in lier sen- 
timents of honour and virtue: and 
although she would sooner die 
than ilmeive that her modesty 
should be drawn into question; 
yet she will think no truth im- 
modest that is to be uttered in the 
vindiiratcd cause of innocence and 
cbaa^. Little, retj littie di^ 



ference is there , my dear youn^ 
lady, between a suppressed evi- 
dence, and false one. 

li is a terrible circumstance, I 
once more own, for a young lady 
of your delicacy, to be under tba 
obligation of telling so shocking 
a story in public court: but it u 
still a worse imputation, that she 
should pass over so mortal an in- 
jury unresented. 

Conscience, honour, justice, are 
on your side: and modesty would, 
by some, bethought but an empty 
unme, should ynu refuse to obey 
their dictates, 

I have been couEulted, I own, 
on this subject. I have given it 
as my opinion, that you ou^t to 
prosecute the abandoned man — ■■ 
but without my reasons. These Ii 
reserved, with a resolution to lay 
them before yon unknown to any: 
body, that the result, if what 7 
wish, may be your num. 

I will only' add, that the iiu«- 
fortunes which have befallen Tou, 
had they been the lot of a child of' 
my own, could not have affectedi 
me more than yours have done. 
My own child 1 love: but 1 both' 
love and honour you: since to IotO' 
you, is to love virtue, good sense, 
prudence, and every thing that is 
good and noble in woman. 

Wounded as 1 think all tbeaV 
are by the injuries you have ra- 
ceived, you will believe that the 
knowledge of your distresses must 
have affiicted, beyond what 1 am 
able to express, 

Your sincere admirer, and 
humble servant, 



I Ijust DOW understand, thatjourlmakea jxtcl^ against those whom 
BiEter will, by proper authority, both duty and inclinatiou bid me

have been unanswerable in almost 
every other case of this nature, but 
in that of the unhappy Clarissa

, till I received your 
affectionate and welcome letter, 
that I had neither father, uncle. 
brother left; nor liardly a friend 
among my former favourers of 
your sex. Yet knowing t/uu so 
well, and having no reason to up- 
brud myself with a faulty will, I 
was to blame (even although I had 
doubted the continuance of your 
good opinion) to decline the trial, 
whether I had forfeited it on '

grief and what punishment are 
ley not treasuring up against 
tbemselres iu the heavy reflections 
which theu7 rash censures and un-

But I find to what your uncle 
Antony's cruel letter is owing, as 
welt as one you will be still more 
afflicted by, [God help you my poor 
dear child ! ] when it comes to your 
hand , written by your sister, with 
proposals to you*. 

It was finished to send you 
yesterday, 1 know; and I apprise 
you of it, that you should fortify 
your heart against the contents 
of it. 

The motiveswhich incline them 
all to this severity , if well 
grounded, would authorize any 
severity they could express, and 
tvliich, while they believe them to 
be so. both they and you are to be 
equally pitied. 

They are owin^ to the informa- 
tion of that officious Mr. Brand, 
who has acquainted them (from 
someenemy of youra in the neigh- 
bourhood about you{ that viaits 
are made yon, highly censurable, 
by a man of a free character, and

Every body has heard, that yon

who, to treat y«K ill , muatbetbe 
vilest of men. Every body knows 
your just resentment of his bitse 
treatment : that you are de-

him: and that yon persist in these 
sentiments against all the entrea- 
ties of his nobierelations, against 
all the prayera and repentance

But, madam, were all the world

it could never have altered mine. 
I ever loved you ; I ever mtist love

resign to my hard fate. When 1 
bad BO manyways, in vain, sought 
lo move you in my favour, I sat 
down seemingly contented. I even

contented. And 1 endeavoured 
to make all my friends and com- j

knows what pangs this self-denial,

cost me! In vain did the chase, in 
did travel, in vain did lively 
company offer themselves, and 
were emoraeed in their turn : with 
redoubled force did my passion 
for you renew my unhappiness, 
when I looked into myself, into 
my own heart; for there did your 
charming image sit enthroned: 
111 you engrossed me all. 
I truly deplore those misfor- 
nes, and those Bufferings, for 
your oicji sake! which, never- 
theless, encourage me to renew 
my bold hope. I know rot par-

UlwCl. HarlowotD AlatWycrloy, Enij. 
But. SUnrdm; . Aug. 36. 

Tub generosity of your purpose 
would have commanded not oniy 
ny notice, but my tbaiiks, al- 
though you had iiol given me the 
iltemaUve you are pleased to call 
srlfiil. And I do therefore give 

Su my thanks for your kind 
ter. 

At the time you distinguished 
me by your favourable opinion, I 
toldyon, sir, that my choice was 
Ihe single life. And moat Indy 
did I tefi you bo. 

When that was not permitted 
toe, and 1 looked round upon the 
M^veral gentlemen who bad been 
^posed to me , and had reason 
to believe that there was not one 
cf tbem agaiust whose morals or 
[irineiples there lay not si/rns ai- 
i^tion, it would not have been 
I'arito be wondered at, ifFiMCv 
kJ been allowed to give a pre- 
torence, where Juqohent was at 
»1qm to determine. 

Far be it from me to say tbia 
sithadesign to upbraid you, sir, 
M to reflect upon you. I always 
«Tshed you well. You had reason 
tolbitikl did, You had the gcue- 
'uaity tobe pleasednith the frank- 
nmsof my Dehaviour toyou; as I 
W with that of yours tome: and 



179 

I am sorry, very sorry, to be now 
told, that the acquiescence yoa 
obliged me with gave you so much 

Hadtheoptionlhavementioned 
been allowed me nftencards (as I 
not only wished but proposed) 
things had not happened that did 
happen. But there was a kind of 
fatality by which our whole family 
was impelled , as I may say ; and 
which none of us were permitted to 
avoid. But this is a subject that 
eannot be dwelt upon. 

As matters are, I have only to 
wish, for your own sake , that you 
will encourage and cultivate those 
good motions in your mmd, to 
which mauy passages in your kind 
and generous letter, now before 
me, must be owing. Depend upon 
It, sir, that such motions, wrought 
into habit, will yield you pleasure 
at a lime when nothing else can. 
And at jire.'en/, shining out in your 
actions and couvetsationj will 
commend Tou to the worthiest of 
our sex. For, sir, the man who is 
good upon choice, as well as by 
education, fasa that quality in him- 
self, which ennobles the human 
race, and without which the most 
dignified by birth or rank are 
ignoble. 

As to the resolution you so 
solemnly make, not to marry while 
I live, I should he concerned at it, 
were I not morally sure , that yon 
may keep it, and yet not be de- 
trirnented by it: since a few, a 
very few days, will convince you, 
that 1 am got above all human 
dependence; and that there is no

Cl. Harlowb. 



I 



Abodt the time of poor Belton'a 
interment last night, as near as we 
could guBBB, LocdM., Mowbray, 
and myself, toasted once. To the 
memory of honestTomBellntii and, 
by a quick tranaitioa to the living, 
HealOi to Miss Harloiee; which 
LordM.obligingly began, and, To 
(fia iappv reconciliation; and then 
we stuck in a remembrance. To 
finnest Jack Belford , who, oflate, 
we all agreed, is become an naeful 
and humaue man; and one who 
prefers his frieud'e service to liis 

But what is the meaning I hear 
nothing from thee?* And why 
dost thou not let me into the 
grounds of the sudden reconcilia- 
tion between my beloved and lier 
friends, and the cause of the ge- 
nerous invitation which she gives 
me of attending her at herfatner's 
some time hence? 

Thou must certainly have been 
let into the secret by this time; 
and I can tell thee, I shall he 
plaguy jealous if there be any one 
thing pass between my angel and 
thee, that is to be concealed from 



me. For either I am a principal 
in this cause, or I am nothing. 

I have dispatched Will to Know 
the reason of thy neglect. 

But, let me whisper a word or 
two in thy ear. 1 begin to be 
afraid, after all, that this letter 
was a stratagem to get me ont of 
town, and tor nothing else; for, 
in the fiist place. Tourville, ins 
letter I received this morning, 
tells me, that the lady is actnalhr 
very ill [1 am sorry for it with all 
m^soullj This, thou'lt say, Im&7 
think a reason why she cannot set 
out as yet: but then I have heard, 
on the other Land , hut last nigh t^ 
that the family is as implacable as 
; and my lord and I eipeet 
veiT afternoon a visit from 
ColonelMorden; who under takes, 
it seems, to question me as tonn' 
intention with regard to bit 




This convinces me , that if she 
has apprised her friends of m^ 
oflers to her , they will not beliera 
me to be in earnest , till they aroc 
assured that I am so from my owa 
mouth. But then I understand,' 
that the intended visit is an of' 
ficiousness of Morden's own, 
without the desire of any of }ifT 
friends. 

Now, Jack, what can a man 
make of all this? My intelligence, 
as^ to the continuance of her fa- 
mily's imp] acahleness, is not to be 
doubted; and yet when I read' 
her letter, what can one say? — ■" 
Surely, the dear little roguewill

thought be would ever have ex-

Thomaaine, they told me, in a

pew, out of curiosity (for it seems 
she was far Irom shewing auy 
tokens of grief) to see the last 
office performed for the man whose 
heart she had so largely contri- 
bnted to break. 

I waa obliged to stay till this

And then she expressed a deep 
concern for what might be the

me, that if now, or at any trnie

invoked a bleaaing npon me for 
my goodness, as she called it , to a 
desolate creature, who suffered 
undertheworifo/'orpAanaje; those 
were her words. 

She then went back to her first 
subject, her uneasiness for fear of 
your molesting her again; and 
said, If you have any in^uence

Ab soon OS I had dispatched m; 
servant to you with my letter of 
the 2Cth, 28th, and yesterday the 
29th, I went to pay my duty to 
her, and had the pleasure to find 
her, ttfter a tolerable nicht, pretty 
lirdy and cheerful. She was hnl 
just returned from her usual de- 
rotions. And Doctor H. alighted 
Be she entered the door. 

After inquiring how she did, 
and hearing her complaints of 
•hortneaa of breath, (which she 
*ttrilHiled to inward decay, preci- 
pitated by her late harasses, as 
well from tier friends as from you) 
he was for advising her to go into 

What will that do for mo? Baid 
ahe; tell me truly, good sir, with a 
eheerfnl aspect, (you know you 
cannot disturb mo oy it) whether 
now you do not put on 
physician; and, despairing that 
any thing in medicine will help 
me, adrise me to the air, as the 
last resource? — Can you think 
the air will avail in such a malady 
•amine? 

He was silent, 

1 ask, said she, because my 
£riend3 (who wilt possibly some 
time hence inquireafter the means 
1 used for my recovery) may be 
satisfied that 1 omitted nothing 
which HO worthy and so skilful a! 
I prescribed. I 

inndam, may possibly'

help the difGcultr of breathing, 
which has so lately attacked you. 

liut, sir, you see how weak lam. 
You must see that I have been 
consumiug from day today; and 
now, if I can judge oy what I feel 
in myself, putting her hand to her 
heart, I cannot eontinne long. If 
the air would very probably add 
to my days, though I am far from 
being ih'sirotis to have them leng- 
thened, 1 would go into it; and 
the rather, as 1 know Mrs. Lovick 
would kindly accompany me. But 
if I were to be at the trouble of 
removing into new lodgings, (a 
trouble which I think now would 
be too much for me) and this only 
to die in the country , I bad rather 
the scene were to be shut up here. 
For here have I meditated the 
spot, and the manner, and every 
thing, as well of the minutest as 
of the highest consequence, that 
can attend the solemn moments. 
So, doctor, tell me truly, may 
I stay here, and be clear of 
any impatations of curtuling, 
through wilfulness or impatience, 
or through resentments , which I 
hope I am got above, a life that 
miffht otherwise he prolonged? — 
Tell me, sir; you are not talking 
to a coward in this respect; 'in- 
deed you are not! — Unaffectedly 
smiling.

at a loss what to say, lifting up 
bis eyes only in admiration of

rectly, I will pat it in other words 
— you don't enjiiin me to go into 
the air, doctor, do youV 

I do no(, madflm. Nor do I now 
visit yoii as a pbyaician ^ but as a 
person whose conversatioD I ad- 
mire , and whose sufleriugs 1 con- 
dole. And to explain myself more 
directly , as to the occasion of this 
day's visit in particular, I must 
tell jou, madam, that, under- 
Btanding how much jou suffer by 
the displeasure of your friends; 
and having no doubt, but that if 
they knew the way you are in, 
they would alter their conduct to 
you; and believing it moat cut 
them to the heart, when, too late, 
they shall be informed of every 
thing; 1 have resolved to apprise 
them by letter (etratiger as I am 
to their peraons) how necessary it 
is for some of them to attend you 
very speedily. For fheir aaies, 
madam, let me press for your ap- 
probation of this measure. 

She paused; and at last said. 
This is Kind, very kind in you, sir. 
But I hope that you do not think 
me so perverse, and bo obstinate, 
as to have left till now any means 
unessayed, which 1 thought likely 
to move my friends in my favour. 
But, doctor, I should now be too 
much disturbed at their grief, if 
they were any of them to come or 
to send to me; and perhaps, if I 
found they still loved me, wishto 
live; and so should quit unwil- 
lingly that life, which I am non 
really fond of quitting , and hop( 
to quit , as becume.s a person wVk 
has had such a weaning time as I 
hare been favoured with 



I hope, madam, said I, you art 
.. jt so near as you apprehend, t* 
that deplorable catastrophe youi 
hint at with such an amaKing pre- 
sence of mind. And therefore I 
presume to second the doctor'! 
motion, if it were only for the' 
sake of your father and motho^' 
that they may have the satisfao-; 
tion, if they mutt lose you, 
think , they were first reconciled' 
to you. 

It is veiT kindly, very humanely 
considered, said she. But if votf

intended interview with Mr. Love- 
lace is over; of which, perhaps, 
Mr. Belford,your next letters mav 
give an account? I hope it will 
not be a fatal one to any body. 
Will you promise me, doctor, 
to forbear writing for two days 
only, and I will communicate to 
you any thing that occurs in that 
and then you shall lak^

He came on horseback, at- 
tended b^ one servant; and Lord 
M. received him, as a relation of 
Miss Harlows's, with the highest 
marks of civility aud respect. 

After tiome general talk of the 
times, and ot the weather, and 
such nonsense as Englishmen ge- 
nerally make their introductory 
topics to conversation, the colonel 
addressed himself to Lord M. and 
to me, as follows : 

I need not, my lord, and Mr. 
Lovelace, as you know the rela- 
tion t bear to the Harlowe family, 
make any apology for entering 
upon a subject, which, on account 
01 that relation, you must think 
is the principal reason of the 
honour 1 1 

Miss Harlowe, Alisa Clarissa 
Harlowe's affair, said Lord M. 
with his usual fortvard bluntuesB. 
That, sir, is what you mean. She 
is, by all accounts, the most excel- 
lent woman in the world. 

I am glad to hear that is your 
lordship's opinion of her. It is 

It is not only my opinion, Co!. 
Morden (proceeded the prating 
peer)but it is the opinion of allmy 
family: of my sisters, of my 
and of nlr. Lovelace him- 



Ihave done myself in 



self. 

Cot. Would to heaven it had al- 
ways been Mr. Lovelace's opinion 
of her! 

Lovei. You have bet 
England, colonel, a good many 
years. Perhaps you are not yet 
fully apjirized of all the pnrtii 
Jars of this case. 



Col. 1 have been out of Eng> 
landj sir, about seven years. My 
cousm Clary was then abont Iwelcfi 
years of age: but never waa theref 
at Iwetiiy so discreet, so prudent 
aud BO excellent a creature. Alt' 
that knew her, or saw her, ad- 
mired her. Mind and person/ 
never did I see snoh promiaes o 

ferfection in any young lady: anf 
am told, nor w it to be wondered 
at, that as she advanced to mato-' 
rity, she more than justified and 
made good those promises. - 
Then as to fortune — what he 
father, what her uncles, andiriii 
I myself, intended to do forberi 
besides what her grandfather hao 
done — there is uot a finer fb ' " 
in the county. 

Lopel. All this, colonel, uid 
more than this, is Miss ClarissA 
Harlowe ; and had it not been for 
the implacableness and viole ' 
of her family (all resolved to pu_^ 
her upon a match as unwortSy w/ 
her, as hateful tu her) ebe had stiff 
been happy. 

Col. I own, Mr. Lovelace, tlu 
truth of what you observed juit 
now, that 1 am uot thoroughly ac- 
quainted with all that has passed 
Between you and my cousin. But 
pei-mit me to say, that when 1 GnC 
heard, that you made your ad- 
dresses to her, I knew hut of onr 
objection against you. That, 
deed,avery great one; and upon 
a letter sent me, I gave her mr 
free opinion upon tne subject' 
But had it not been for that, 1. 
own, that in my private mind 
there could not have been a mora 

• See Vol. U. p. MI, k leq.

CLARISSA HAItLOWB. 



BnHable match: for you are a gal- 
lant geutleman, graceful in your 
person, easy and genteel in your 
deportment, and iu yonr family, 
fortunes, aud expectations, happy 
as a man can wish to be. Then 
the knowledge I had of you in 
Italy (although, give me leave to 
say, your conduct there was not 
wholly uneiueptionahle) con- 
vinces me that you are brave: and 
few gentlemen come up to you in 
wit and vivacity. Your education 
haH given you great advantages; 
your maiiuers are engaeitiR, and 
you have travelled; and I know, 
if you'll excuse me, you make 
better observations than you are 
governed by. All these qualifica. 
tions make it not at all surprising, 
that a young lady should love 
you: and that this love, joined to 
that indiacreet warmth wherewith 
my cousin's friends would have 
forced her inclinations in favour 



ofm 






shonld throw her upon your pro- 
tection. But then, if there were 
these two strong motives, the one 
to induce, the other to impel her, 
let me ask you, sir, ifshe were not 
doubly entitled to generous usage 
from a man whom she chose for 
her protector; and whom, let me 
take the liberty to say, she could 
so amply reward for the protec- 
tion he was to afford her? 

Lnuel. Miss Clarissa Harlowe 
was entitled, sir, to the beat usage 
that man could give her. I have 
no scruple to own it I will al- 
ways do her the justice that she 
so well deserres. X know what 



19b 

will be your inference; and have 
ouly to say, that time. past can- 
uot be recalled. Perhaps I wish 
it could. 

The colonel, then in a very 
manly strain, set forth the wickea- 
ness of attempting a woman of 
virtue and character. He said 
that men had generally too many 
advantages from the weakness, 
credntity, and inexperience of the 
fair sex : that their early learning, 
which chiefly consisted in in- 
flarniag novels, and idle and im- 
probable romances, contributed 
to enervate and weaken their 
minds : that his cousin, however, 
he was sm-e, was above the reach 
of common seduction, and not to 
be influenced to the rashness her 
parents accused her of, by weaker 
motives than Iheir violence, and 
the most solemn promises on my 
part: but, nevertheless, kavinr; 
those motives and her pmdenoe 
(eminent as it was) being rather 
the eSectoicimsiiUiiiontiiaatxpO' 
rieitce, (a fine advantage, however, 
he said, to ground anunblameable 
ftiture life upon] she might not be 
apprehensive of bad designs in a 
man she loved: it was therefore, a 
very heinous thing to abuse the

manner; when, interrupting him, 
I said: These general observa- 
tions, colonel, suit not perhaps 
this particular case. But you

He proceeded. As yon seem to 
call upon me, Mr. Lovelace, I will 
tell you (withont boasting of it) 
what has been my general prac- 
tice, till lately, that 1 hope I have 
reformed it a good deal. 

Ihave taken iiburtiea, wbioh the 
lawa of morality will by no meana 
justify; and once I should have 
tkooKht myself warranted to cut 
the uiroat of aiiy young fellow, 
who should make as free with a 
sister of mine, »s 1 have made

others. liut then I took c 
never to promise any thing I 
tended not to perform. A moc 
ear should as soon have hoard 
downright obacenity from my 
lips, as matrimony, it I had not '- 
tended it. Young ladies are ^ 
nerally ready enough to believe 
we mean honourably, if they love 
ua; and it would look like a 
strange afiVont to their virtue and 
charms , that it should be sup- 
posed needfal to put the (juestion 
whether, in your address,

makes a promise, I think it 
ought to Le performed; ai: ' " ' 



woman is well ivarrauted to ap-

fidy of a deceiver; and is alwsyi 
iure to have the world on bet 

Now, Sir, continued he, Ibe- 
lieve yon have so much honour 
as to own, that yon could not

Lovel. (cooilij) Come, come, 
Col. Morden, don't let thia dis- 
pute, whatever you intend to 
make of it, go further than nitfa 
you and me. You deliver your- 
self in very high terma. Higher 
than ever I was talked to in my 
life. But here, beneatli this roof, 
it would be inexcusable for me to 
take that notice of it, which per- 
haps it would become me to take 
elsewhere. 

C'lL This is spoken as I wish 
the man to speak , whom I should 
be pleased to call my friend, if ail 
his actions were of a piece; and 
as I would have the man speak, 
whom 1 would think it worth my 
while to call my foe. I love a 
mail of spirit, as I love my soul. 
But, Mr. Lovelace , as my lord 
thinks we aim at otiemarh^ let me 
say , that were we permitted to be 
aloue for sii minutes , I dare aay, 
we should eoon understand oue

when at the same time the doing

Colonel Morden to be, (rash as 

Eerhaps in this visit he has ibewii

comes to my Lord M.'s bonse, in

Mowbray, leave us. You have 
really no concern in this bueinesa; 
and if you are my friend, I desire 
you'll ask the colonel pardon for 
interfering in it in the manner yon 
have done. 

M<mhr. Well, well, Bob; thou

have no doubt of Mr. Lovelace'ft 
ability to defend his own c&oM, 
were it a cause to be defended. 
And let me tell you, Ur. Lore*

think, that a brave man, and ■ 
generous man , as you have Wf- 
peared to be in two or three in-

courage, and genevosity to boot, 
let me desire you to lay youT 
beads together nmicHbly, and 
think whether there be any thing 
to be done to make all endhappily 
for the lady, 

LiivpI. But hold, my lord, let 
me say one thing now Mowbray k 
gone; and that is, that I think a 
gentleman ought not to put up 
tamely one or two severe things 
that the colonel has said. 

L-rd M. Wtat the devil canst 
thou mean? I thought all 
been over. Why thon haat 
thing to do , but to confirm to 
colonel, that thou art willing to 
manj Miss Ilarlowe, if she will 
have thee. 

Col. Mr. Lovelace will not 
BCrupIe to say Ibal, I suppose, not- 
withalandmg all thut has passed: 
but if you think, Mr. Lovelace, 
1 have said any thing I should not 
have aaid. I suppose it is tf 
that the man who has shewn 
little of the tliiiii/ honour, to 
defenceless unprotected womt 
ought not to stand so nicely upon 
the empit) name of it, with a man 
who is expostulating with him 
Upon it. I am sorry to have cause 
to Bay this, Mr. Lovelace; but I 
would on the same occasion, re- 
peat it to a king upon his throne, 
and surrounded Dy all his guards.

bring about a reconciliation with

it ia not a little owing to ber fa-

herTileiy; but is willing to repair 
her wrongs — 

Lord. Not, my lord, for tlie 
sake of her family; nor for this 
gentleman's haughty behaviour; 
but for her oicn saire, and in full 
sense of the wrongs 1 have done 

Col, As to roy hauglity be-

gone beyond itiu the like case, of 
a relation so meritorious, and so 
unworthily injured. And, sir, let

are not love, honour, and justice, 
and if they have the least tmcture 
of meancompaasion forfcr, or of 
an uncheerfiil asseat on yow par/, 
I am sure it will neither be desired

that 1 am meanly compounding 
ofFadebate, that I should as wiir

given me for it; but thus much^ 
will tell you, that my lord, th&U

this he wanted to declare, and 
would soiHier have declared, if he 
could have brought us sooner to 
patience , and a good under- 
standing. 

The colonel made excuses for 
his warmth, on the score of his 
affectionto his cousin. 

My regard for her made me 
readily admit them; andsoafresh 
bottle of Burgundy, and another

I told the colonel, "whateamest

upon the lady not to slip a day 
that had been proposed for the 
private celebration of our nuptiala ; 
and of my letters* written to her-

stepped to my closet, and fetched 
down all the letters and draughts, 
and copies of letters, relating to 
this affaur. 

I read to him "several passages 
in the copies of those letters, which

him, "that 1 wished I bad kept

how much in earnest I 
professions to her, al- 
thoueh sfie would not answer oi 
of them." And thou njay'st n 
member, that ono of those fboT 
letters accounted to herself, wb/ 
1 was desirous she should remain, 
where I had left her.* 

I then proceeded to give him ta,' 
account "of the visit made hf, 
Lady Sarah and Lady Betty to

me to do her justice: ofmytead)^

annual tender which Lord M. and 
his Biaters made to Lia fair cousin, 
ia apprehension that she might 
Buffer Dy her friends' implacaffie- 

And this also the colonel hiehly 
applauded, and was pleased to 
lament the unhappy misunder- 
standing between the two families, 
which had made the Uarlowes leas 
fond of an alliance with a family 
of 80 much honour, as this iustance 
shewed ours to be. 

I then told him, "that having, 
by my friend, [meaning thee] who 
was admitted into her presence, 
(and who had always been an 
admirer of her virtues, and had 
pvennte such advice from time to 
Ume in relation to her as 1 wished 
I had followed) been assured, that 
a visit from me would be very dis- 
agreeable to her, I once more 
resolved to try what a letterwould 
do; and that, accordingly, on the 
7th of August 1 wrote to her one. 

"This, colonel, is the copy of it. 
I was then out of humour with my 
lOrdlfT. and the ladies of myfa- 
Tou will therefore read it 
bjonradf."*

This letter gave him high aatis- 
faction. You write here , Mr, 
Lovelace, from your heart. 'Tisa 
letter full of penitence and ac- 
knowledsment. Your request is 
reasonable — to be forgiven only 
as you shall appear to deserve it 
after a time of probation, which 
you leave to her to fix. Pray, sir, 
did she return an answer to this 
letter? 

She did, but with I'e/MCfaitce, I 
own, and not tilll had declared by 
my friend, that if 1 could not pro- 
cure one, I would go up to town, 
and throw myself at her feet. 

1 wish 1 might be permitted to 
see it, sir, or to hear such parts 
of it read, as you ahall think 
proper. 

Turoiug over my papers, Here 
it is, sir.* I will make no scruple 
to put it into your hands. 

This is very obliging, Mr.Love- 

Hereadit. Mycharmingcousin! 
— How strong her resentment! — 
Yet, how charitable herwishesl 
Good heaven! that such an ei- 
cellent creature — but, Mr. Love- 
lace , it is to your regret, as much 
as to mine, 1 doubt not — 

Interrupting him, I swore that 
it was. 

Soitought, said be. Nordol 
wonder that it should be so. I 
shall tell you by-und-by, pro- 
ceeded he, how much she suffers 
with her friends by false and 
villainous reports. But, sir. will 
yon permit me to take with me 
these two letters? I shall make

use of them to the advantage of 
you both. 

I told him, I would oblige him 
with all my heart And this he 
took very kindly (as he had rea- 
son) ; and put them in his pocket- 
book, promising to return them in 
a few days. 

I then told him, " that upon this 
her refusal, I took upon myself to 
go to town, in hopes to move her 
m my favour; and that, though I 
went without giving her notice of 
my intention, yet had she got some 
notion of my coming , and so con- 
trived to be out of the way : and 
at last, when she found I was fully 
determined at all events to see her, 
before I went abroad, (which I 
shall do, said I, if I cannot prevail 
upon her) she sent me the letter I 
have already mentioned to you, 
desiring me to suspend my pur> 
posed visit: and that for a reason 
which amazes and confounds me \ 
because I don*t find there is any 
thing in it: and yet I never knew 
her once dispense with her word ; 
for she always made it a maxim, 
that it was not lawful to do «i7, that 
good might come of it: and yet in 
this letter, for no reason in the 
world but to avoid seeing me, (to 
gratify an humour only) has she 
sent me out of town, depending 
upon the assurance she had given 
me. 

Col, This is indeed surprising. 
But I cannot believe that my 
cousin, for such an end only, or in> 
deed for any end, according to the 
character 1 hear of her, should 
stoop to make use of such an 
artince. 



Lovel, This, colonel, is the tiung 
that astonishes me; and yet, see 
here! — This is the letter she 
wrote me — nay , sir , 'tis her own 
hand. 

Col. I see it is; and a charming 
hand it is. 

LoveL You observe, colonel, 
that all her hopes of reconciliation 
with her parents are from yon. 
You are her dear blessed friend! 
She always talked of you with 
delight. 

Col. Would to heaven I had 
come to England before she left 
Harlowe Place ! — Nothing of this 
had then happened. Not a man 
of those whom I have heard that 
her friends proposed for her, 
should have had her. Nor yon, 
Mr. Lovelace , unless I had found 
you to be the man, every one who 
sees you must wish you to be: and if 
you had been that man, no one 
living should I have preferred to 
you for such an excellence. 

Mj lord and I both joined in the 
wish: and 'faith I wished it most 
cordially. 

The colonel read the letter twice 
over , and then returned it to me. 
'Tis all a mystery, said he. I can 
make nothing of it. For, alas ! her 
friends are as averse to a recon- 
ciliation as ever. 

Lord M. I could not have 
thought it. But don't you think 
there is something very favour- 
able to my nephew in this letter 
— something tnat looks as if the 
lady would comply at last? 

Col. Let me die if I know what 
to make of it. This letter is very 
different from her preceding one. 



ri- You returned an answer to it, 
Mr. Lovelace? 
Lnvel. An answer, colonel! No 
doubt of it. And an answer full 
of transport. 1 told her, "I would 
directly set out for LordM.'s, in 
obedience to Uer will. I told her 
that I would consent to an; tiling 
she should command , in order to 

r'omote this hapjiy reconciliation, 
told her, thiLt it should be my 
hourly study to the end of my life, 
to deserve a goodness so transcen- 
dent" But I cannot forbear Bay- 
ing, that I am not a little shocked 
andenrpriied, if nothingmorebe 
meant by it , than to get me into 

^tIle country without seeing her. 
Col. That can't be the thing, 
'«|epeaduponit,sir: there must be 
iboie in it thsii that. For were 
Aat all, she must think you would 
soon be undeceived , and that you 
woald then most probably resume 
your intention ~ unless , indeed, 
she depended upon seeing tiie in 
the interim, as she knew 1 wtis 
arrived. But I own, I know not 
what to make of it. Only that

But I shall know better how to^

James comes from Edinburgh; 
and he is every hour espected. 

But let me ask you, Mr. Love- 
lace, what is the name of your 
friend , who is admitted so easily 
into my cousin's presence? Is it 
not Belford, pray? 

Lovel. It is, air; Mr.Belford is 
amau of honour; andagreatad- 
mirer of your fair cousin. 

Was 1 right, as to the ;?<■,!/, Jack ? 
The laul 1 have such strong proof 
of, that it makes me questjon the 
^rst; since she would not have 
been out of the way of my intend- 
ed visit but for thee. 

Cot. Are you sure, air, that Mr. 
Belford is a man of honour? 

Liipcl. I can swear for him, 
colonel. What makes you put 
this question? 

Col. Only this; that anofficiouf 
pragmatical novice has been sent 
up to inquire into my cousin's life 
and conversation; and, would you 
believeitjthei'reQueutvisiUof this 
:entleman have oeen interpreted 



and you will be shocked at every 
part of it. 

This cursed letter, no doubt, is 
from the young Levite, whom 
thou. Jack, descrihedat, as making 
inquiry of Mrs. Smith about Miss 
Harlowe's character and visitors.* 

I believe I was a quarter of an 
hour in reading it: fori made it, 
though not a short one, six times' 
as long as it is, by the additions of 
oaths and curses to every pedantic 
line. Lord M. too helped to 
lengthen it, by the like ezecra- 



* aeev.S&i^Vwit 



tions. And thou, Jack, wilL have 
asmucLreason tocurseit as we. 

You cannnt but see, said the 
colonel, yiben 1 had done reading 
it, that thiBfellowhaabeen ii/yfci'ouj' 
in his malevolence; for what he 
saya ie mere hearaay, and that 
hearaay conjectural scandal, 
without fact, or the appearance 
of fact, to support it; bo tbatan 
nnprejudiced eye, upon the face 
of the letter, would condemn the 
writer of it , as I did , and acquit 
my cousin. But yet, such ia the 
Bpiritby which the rest of my rela- 
tions are governed , that they run 
away with the belief of the worst 
itinsinnates, and the dear creature 
has had shocking letters upon it; 
the pedant's hints are taken . and 
a voyage to one of the colonies 
has been proposed to her, as the 
only way to avoid Mr. Belford and 
you. I have not seen these letters, 
indeed; but they took a pride in 
repeating aome of their contents, 
which must have cut the poor aoul 
to the heart; and these, joined to 
her former sufferinga — what have 
you not, Mr. Lovelace, to answer 
for? 

Jju'el. Wbolhedevilconldhave 



there could be parents so impla- 
cable? Brother and sister so

body? — And what now can be

lus cousin. And by her last letter, 
it runs in my mind , that she bai 
some thoughts of forgiving all 
that's past. Do you thinK, colonel, 
if there should not be such a thing 
as a reconciliation going faiwara 
at present, that her letter may oot- 
imnl^, that if we t^'iu/fJ bring sQcli 
a Uiing to bear with her friends, 
she would be reconciled withMr. 
Lovelace? 

C'll. Such an artifice would 
better become the Italian aub- 
tility, than the English sii 
Your lordship has been it 
presume? 

Loeel. My lord has read Boc- 
.caccio, perhaps; and that's as 
well, aa to the hint he gives, which 
may be borrowed from one of that 
author's stories. But MisaCIfliTisrt 
Harlowe is above all artifice. Shs 
must have some meaning I a 
fathom. 

Col. Well, my lord, I can only 
say, that I will make soineuseof 
the letters Mr. LoreJace baa ob- 
liged me with: and after 1 b 
had some talk with my oouria 
James, who is hourly expected) 
and when 1 have dispatched two 
or three affairs that press upon 
me; 1 will pay myrespecta toBiy 
dear cousin; and shall then H 
able to form a bet 
things. Me3ntim< 
her; for 1 have a 
about her, and find she wanU 
consolation. 

Ltivel- If you favour me, co- 
lonel, with the d— n'd letter of 
that fellow Brand, for a day o 
two, you will oblige me. 

Col. Iwill, but remember, itj 



^najt isaparson, Mr.Lovelace; an 
iBaocent one too they eaj. Else 
1 had been at him before now. 
AAd these college novices^ who 
think thej know everj thing in 
their cloisters , and that all learn- 
ing lies in bouts, make dismal 
figureB when they come into the 
world among inen and icnrnen. 

Lord M. Brand! Bniiid! It 
should have been Firebraml , I 
tbiiikf inmy conscience! 

Thua ended thia doughty con- 
ference. 

1 cannot say, Jack, hut I am 
greatly taken with Col. Morden. 
He is bravo and gecerona, and 
knowB the world; and then biB 
contempt of the jiaraonn ia a 
t&in Eign that he is one of us. 

We parted with great civi 
Liord U. (not a little pleased that 
wo did, and as greatly taken with 
the colonel) repeated his wish, 
after the colonel was gone, that 
he had arrived in time to save the 
lady; if that would have done it. 

I wish so too. For, by my aonl, 
Jack, I am every day more and 
more uneaay about her. Butlhope 
she is not BO ill as I am told she is. 

IhavemadeCharlotte transcribe 
the letter of thia Firehranil, as my 
lord calls him; and will inclose 
her copy of it. All thy phlegm 1

ance when thou rcadest it, 

I know not what to adi'ise as 
to Bhewing it to the lady. Yet, 
perhaps, she will be ablt

innocence; in that it will give

and for their proposal to her of 
;oing to some one of the colonies. 
Confound them all — but if I

One word more, as to a matter of 
erudiliun, which yougreatlylove

Dr. Lewen once, in your pre- 
sence, (as yon, my good patrnti, 
eanuot but remember) in a, 
siurtrliii kind of debate be- 
tween hint and me, took upon 
him to censure thejiarmlhetical 
style, as I call it. He was a very 
learned and judicious man, to 
be sure, and an ornament to niir 
functitin: but yet I must needs 
say, that it is a style which 1 
greatly lilte ; and the good doc- 
tor was then past his yiuth, and 
that time of life, of consequence, 
when a fertile {maifmatiim, and 
i-ich faniy, pour in ideas ao fast 
Qpon a writer, that parentheses 
are often wanted (and that for 
the salie of hrecity, as well as 
perspicuity) to save the reader 
the trouble of reading apassage 
more than iiace. Every man to 
his talent (as 1 said before). We 
are all so apt to set up our 
notiirol WoKSes for general stan- 
darilSf that I wondered Ijie lest 
at the worthy doclor'a eliffhey« 
on this occasion. He smiled at 
me, you may remember, sir —

sure 1 smiled a! lUm. And

a great deal of this last implaca-

although 1 had been come irom 
thence but about imhour, andhad 
taken leave of the lady for the 
night. 

I sent down for Mrs. Lovicfc, and 
desired her, in the firatplace, to 
acquaint the lady (who was busied 
in ber closet) that I had letters 
from Berks; in which 1 was in- 
formed that the interview between 
Col. Morden and Mr. Lovelace had 
ended without ill consequences^ 
that the colonel intended to write 
to her very soon, and was bterest- 
ing himself meanwhile in her fa- 
vour, with her relations: that I 
hoped, that this agreeable news 
would be the means of giving her 
good rest; and I would wait upon 
her in the morning, by the time 
she should return from prayers, 
with all the particulars. 

She sent me word, that ahe 
sliould be glad to aee me in the 
morning; and was highly obliged 
to me for the good newslhad sent

to Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith,

in what one could and rrmld nni 
readtoa womanof eofineamind; 
since four pnrts out of six of thj 
letters, which I thought enter-

appeared to me, when I would 
have read them to her, most ab- 
ominable atuif, and gave mea very 
contemptible idea of thy talents, 
and of my own judgment. 

She was far from rejoicing, ae 
I had done, at the disappointment 
her letter gave you when 
plained. 

She said, nhe meant only ai 
nocent allegory, which might 
carry instruction and warning to 
you, when the meaning was taken, 
a,e well as answer her own bopcf 
for the time. It was run off in « 
hurry. She was afraid it was not 
quite right in her. But hoped the 
end would excuse [if it could not 
justify) the means. And then she 
again expressed a good deal of 
apprehension, lest you should still 
t^e it into your head to molest 
her, when her time, she said, was 
BO short, that she wanted every 
moment of it; repeating what she 
bad said once before, that when 
she wrote, she was so ill, that she 
believed she should not have lived 
till now. If she had thought she 
should, she must have studied for 
an expedient that would have 
better answered her intentions.

knowledge of ua both.

Nor think me , my dear cousin, 
blameable for refusing him. I hod 
eiven Mr. Lovelace no reason to 
think me a weak creature. If I 
Imd, aman of his character might 
have thought himself warranted 
to endeavour to take ungeneroue 
advantage of the weakness he 
had been able to inspire. The 
consciousness ofmgoipii weakness 
(in that case) might have brought 
me to a composition with lii.i 
wickedness, 

I can indeed forrive him. But 
that is, because 1 think his crimes 
have set me above him. Caul be

I CAKHOT bat own, that I am cut 
tothebeaj't bf //tin Miss Uarlowe'a 
interpretation of hei letter. She 
ought never to be forgiven. She, 
a meek person, and a peuiteut, 
aud innocent, and pious, and I 
kuoiT not what, who can decei' 
with a foot in the grave ! — 

'Tie evident, that she sat down 
to write this letter with a design 
to mialead and deceive. And if 
she be capable of that, at such a 
oriBis, ahe haa as much need of 
keaveifs forgiveness , as 1 have of 
hers: and, with all her cant of 
charity and diariii/, if she be not 
Kiore sure of it than 1 am of her 
real parihii, and if she talce the 
thing in the hght she ought to 
take it in , she will have a few 
darker moments yet to come than 
she seems to expect. 

Lord M. himself, who is not one 
of those (to speak in his own 
phrase) hjAo can penetrate a mlll- 
tliine,Bsea the deceit, and thinks it

piece with thy generosity to thy 
Rosebud and her Johnny ; and to 
a number of other good actions, 
in pecuniary matters: although 
thy Rosebud's is, I believe, the 
only instance, where a pretty' 
woman was concerned, of such a 
disinterested bounty. 

Upon my faith, Lovelace, I love 
topraisethee; and often and often, 
as thou knowest, have I studied for 
occasions to do it : insomuch, that 
when for the life of me I could not 
think of any thing done by thee 
that deserved praise, I have taken 
pains to applaud the not ungrace- 
ful manner in which thou hast 
performed actions that merited 
the gallows. 

Now thou art so near, I will 
dispatch my servant to thee if 
occasion recjuires. But, I fear, I 
shall soon give thee the news thou 
apprehendest. For I am just now 
sent for by Mrs. Smith; who has 
ordered the messenger to tell me, 
that she knew not if the lady will 
be alive when I come. 

Friday, Sept. 1. Two o'clock at Smith's. 

I COULD not close my letter in 
such an uncertainty as must have 
added to your impatience. For 
you have, on several occasions, 
convinced me , that the suspense 
you love to give, would be the 
greatest torment to you that you 
could receive. A common case with 
all aggressive and violent spirits, 
I believe. I will just mention then 
(your servant waiting here till I 
nave written) that the lady has 
had two very severe fits: in the 
last of which whilst she lay, they 



sent to the doctor and Mr. God- 
dard , who both advised that a 
messenger should be dispatched 
for me, as her executor; bebg 
doubtful whether, if she had a 
third, it would not carry her off. 

She was tolerably recovered by 
the time I came; and the doctor 
made her promise before me, that, 
while she was so weak, she would 
not attempt any more to go 
abroad; for, by Mrs. Lovick's 
description who attended her, the 
shortness of her breath, her ex- 
treme weakness , and the fervour 
of her devotions when at church, 
were contraries, which, pulling 
different ways, (the soul aspiring, 
the body sinking) tore her tender 
frame in pieces. 

So much for the present. I shall 
detain Will no longer than just to 
beg , that you will send me back 
this packet, and the last. Your 
memory is so good, that once 
reading is all you ever give, or 
need to give, to any thing. And 
who but ourselves can make oirf 
our characters, were you inclined 
to let any body see what passes 
between us? Ifl cannot be obliged, 
I shall be tempted to with-nold 
what I write till 1 have time to take 
a copy of it. * 

A letter from Miss Howe is just

and even to the philosophers of 
antiquity) have been manifested? 

I EDOW thou wilt think I am 
going to claim some merit to 
mysdf, for having given her such 
opportunities of signalizing her 
virtues. But I am not; for, if I did, 
I must share that merit with her 
implacable relations, who would 
justly be entitled to two-ildrds of 
it, at least : and my soul disdains 
a partnership in any thing with 
such a family. 

But this I mention as an answer 
to thy reproaches that I could be 
so little edified by the perfections, 
to which thou supposest, I was for 
so long together daily and hourly 
a personal witoess — when admir- 
able as she was in all she said, and 
in all she did, occasion had not at 
that time ripened, and called forth 
those amazmg perfections which 
now astonish ana confound me. 

Hence it is , that I admire her 
more than ever; and that my love 
for her is less personal^ as I may 
gay, more intellectual, than ever I 
thought it could be to woman. 



Hence als^ :t is, thak I am eon- 
fident would it please the Fates 
to spare her, and make her mine) 
I could love her with a purity thtt 
would draw on auf omm Fcnras, ts 
well as ensure Ker TaaomAL hap- 
piness. — And henee, bjneeessaiy 
consequence, shall 1 be the most 
miserable of all men, if 1 am de- 
prived of her. 

Thou severely reflectest iqMm 
me for my levity; the Abbey in- 
stance in thine eye, I suppose. 
And I will be ingenuous enongh 
to own, that as thou seestnotmy 
heart , there may be passages, in 
every one of my letters, which (the 
; melancholy occasion considered) 
I deserve thy most pointed rebukes. 
i But, faith. Jack, thou art such a 
tragi -comical mortal, with thy 
leaden aspirations at one time, 
and thy flying hour-glasses and 
i dreaming terrors at another, that, 
as Prior says. What serious iSj thu 
turri'st to farce; and it is impos- 
sible to keep within the bounds 
of decorum or gravity, when one 
reads what thou writest. 

But to restrain myself, (for mj 
constitutional gaiety was ready to 
run away with me again) I will 
repeat, I must ever repeat, that 
I am most egregiously affected 
with the circumstances of the 
case: and, were this paragon 
actually to quit the world!, should 
never enjoy myself one hour to- 
gether, though I were to live to 
the age of Methusalem. 

Indeed it is to this deep concern, 
that my lemty is owing: for 1 
struggle and struggle, and tij to 
buffet down my cruel reflections

a itii'ced, oslhave often Bald,!

I may not cry: for one or other I 
must do: audiaituot philoKO^h}' 
carried to the higheaC pitch, for v, 
maji to conquer such tumults of 
Boul as I am sometimes agitated 
by, and, in thevery height of the 
Blorm, to be able to quaver out an 
horse-laugh? 

You rSenecafl,yourEpicletuBes. 
and the reat of your stoical tribe, 
with all their apathy-nonaense, 
could not come up to this. They 
could fbrbear wry faces; bodily 
pains they could well enough seeai 
to support; and that was all: hut 
the pangs of their own sinitten' 
down souls they could not lauff) 
over, though they could at Iht 
follies of others. They read grave 
lectures; but they icere grave. 
This high point of philoaophy, to 
laugh and be merry in the midst 
of the most aoul- harrowing 
when the heart-strings " "

There is something owing to 
Itotitution, lown; and that thif

bearing them.

The lady ia alive, and serene, 
and calm, and baa all her noble 
intellects clear and strong: but 
nineteen will not however save her. 
She says, she will ni^w content her- 
self with her closet duties, and the 
visits of the parish minister; 
will not attempt to go out. Nor, 
indeed, will she, I am afraid, ever 
walk up or down a pair of Etairs 



I a 



JOrry at my soul to have 
ly : but it would be a folly 



this to say 
to flatter thee. 

Aa to thy seeing her, I believe 
the least hint of that sort, now, 
would cut off some houra of her 
life. 

What baa contributed 
serenity, it seems, ia that taking 
the alarm her fits gave her, she 
has entirely finisbed, and signed 
and sealed, her last will: which 
she had deferred doing till tbis; 
time, in hopes, as she said, of some i 



good news from Harlowe Place, 
nhich would have induced her [o 
alter some passages in it. 

KIJEsHowe's letter wasnot given 
her till foor in the aftemoon, 
yesterday; at which time the 
messenger returned fbrananswer. 
She admitted faim into her pre- 
sence in the dining- room, ill asshe 
then was, and she would have 
written a few lines, aadeairedby 
Miss Howe; but not being able to 
hold a pen, ahe bid themeBaenget 
tell her, that she hoped to be w«ll 
enough to write a long letter bj 
ueit day's post; and wonla 
□o<v detain him. 



CALLED just now, and foiml, 
the lady writing to Miss Hoha 
She made me a melancholy con- 
>liment, that she shewed me not 
liss Howe's letter, because I 
hould soon have that and all bet 
papers before me. But she toU 
me, that Miss Ho we bad very oo*' 
siderately obviated to Coloid 
Morden several things which 
might have occasioned misappl*- 
benstons between him and m»\ 
and had likewise put aligbter con- 
struction, for the aake ofpeace,ei 
some of your actions, taaa tb«r 
deserved. 

She added, that her counn 
Morden was warmly engaged in 
her favour with her friends; and 
one good piece of neirs Hio 
Howes letter contained; that bet

froj^era, I shall again be happy. 
write with still the more alacrity, 
aa I have an opportunity pivenme 
to tODch upon a subject in which 
yoa are nearly concerned. 

You must know then, my dear, 
that your cousin Morden has been 
here with me. He told me of an 
interview he had on Monday at < 
Lord M.'s with Lovelace; and 
asked me abundance of qnestiooB 
about you , and about that 
viilainoua man. 

I could have raised a fine flame 
between them if I would: but, 
observing that he is a man of very 
livelv passiona, and believing you 
would be miserable if any thiug 
should happen to him from a 
quarrel with a man who is known 
to have so many advantages athis 
aword, I made not the worst of the 
subjects we talked of. Bi 
could not tell untruths 
favour, you must think I said 
enough to make him curse the 
wretcli. 

I don't find, well as they used to 
respect Colonel Morden, that he 
has influence enough upon them 
to bring them to any terms of re- 
conciliation. 

What can they mean by it? — 
But your brother ia come home, it 
seems; so, the honour of the house, 
the reputation of the family, is all 
the cry 1 

The colonel ia exceedingly out 
of humour with them all. Yet has 
he not hitherto, it seems, i 
jfoar bmtal hrolhei. I told 



how ill yon were, i 
cated to him eome of the content! 
of your letter. He admired yau, 
cursed Xdcefarc. and raved against 

all your family, — He declared, 
that they were all unworthy <» 
yon. 

At his earnest request, 1 per- 
mitted him to take some brirf 
notes of such of the contents ofi 
your letter to rae, as I thought I 
cimlil read to him; and, particu- 
larly, of your melancholy 
elusion.* 

Me says, that none of yoni 
friends think yon so ill as yoa AM| 
nor will believe it. He is mii 
they all love you, and that dea^

lour cousin imagines, that, 

^Tre a reconciliation takes pi ace, 
r will ineiat, that you shall 
:esiich a will, as to that estate, 
a they ahall approve of; but he 
declares, he will not go out of 
England till he has seen justice 
done you by eaery l/ody; and that 



yon shall not be imposed on either 
by friend or foe — 

IJy relation or foe, should he not 
have said ? — For a friend will not 
impoae upon a friend. 

So, my dear, you are trf Any ji'cr 
peace, if some people are to have 
their wills! 

Your cousin [not /, my dear, 
though it was always myopinion"] 
aays, that the whole family ia Ion 
rir/i, to he either himhU, ron- 
«iilerale, or cin/nitaf. And as for 
himaelf , he has an ample fortune, 
he snys, and thinks of leaving it 
wholly to j-ou. 

Had this Tiliain Lovelace con- 
sulted his worldly interest atily, 
what a fortune would he have had 
in yon, even although your marry- 
ing him had lieprived you of a 
paternal share ! 

I am obliged to leave off here. 
But having a good deal still to 
write, ana my mother better, I 
will pursue the subject in another 
letter, although I send both to- 

f ether. 1 need not say how much 
am, and will ever be,

letters you had written to your

worse than perjury, broach of 
faith, and abuse of a generous 
confidence, were to appearl — 

Iaorry fellowsl] he would avenge 
lis cousin to the utmost. 

I urged your apprehensiona on 
thia head from your last letter to 
me: but he seemed capable of 
taking what I kuow to be real 
greatness of Goul, in an unworthy 
sense: for he meutioned directly 
upon it, the eipectatiou your 
friends had, that you should (pre- 
vious to any reconciliation with 
them) appear in a court of justice 
against the villain — If you could 
do it with the advantage to your- 
self that I hiuted might be done. 

And truly.ifl would havebeard 
him, he had indelicacy euougli to 



have gone into the nature of the 
proof of the crime upon which thsj 
wanted to have Lovelace a^ 
raigned. Yet thia is a man im- 

B roved by travel and learning! —

have been accustomed t« the moM 
delicate conversation ever nncefl 
had the honour to know yon, (JM 
apiae this sei from the gentlemllF 
down to the peasant. 

Upon the whole , I find that Ht, 
Morden has avery slender notim 
of women's virtue, iu particalO' 
cases: for which reason I pot bin 
down, though yourfavourite, at 
one who is not entitled tn cant (1*

I never knew a man who de- 
served to be well thougbt of hin-

the difference of leniperamait Iiii

LETTER xcvi. 



I vroKCEs not at the impatience 
your servant tells me you express 
to bcur from me. I was designiuf 
to write you a loDg tetter, am 
was just returned from Smith' 
for tbat purpose; bat since yoi 
are BO urgent, you must be con 
tented with a short one. 

J attended the lady thie morn 
iug, just before I set out for 
Kdgeware. She was bo ill over 
night, that she was obliged t( 
leave unfinished her letter to Mis 
Howe, But early this mominf 
she made an end of it, and bai 
just sealed it up as I came. Shi 
was so fatigued with writing, tbat 
she told me she would lie down 
after I waa gone, and endeavour 
to recruit her apirits. 

They bad sent for Mr. Goddard, 
when she was so ill last night; 
and Hot being able to see nim 
out of her own chamber, he, for 
the first time, saw her house as 
she calls it. He was extremely 
shocked and concerned at it; and 
chid Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick 
for not persuading her to have 
such an object removed from ' 
bed-chombei': and when they 



cused themselves on the lillU 
itharity it was reasonable to suu- 
poae they must have with a lady 
so much their superior, here- 
fleeted warmly ou those whohad 
re authority, and who lefther 
proceed with such a shock- 
; and solemn whimsy , as be 
lied it. 

It is placed near the windo*. 
like a harpsichord, thoiieh covered 
to the ground: and wbenshe 
ill , tbat she cannot well go 
to her closet, she writes and reads 
upon it, SB othera would uponi 
desk or table. But (only aa ahe 
ill last night) she cfaooau 
tee any body in that apart 

I went to Edgewttre; aud, re- 
turning in the evening, attended 
her again. She bad a letter 
brought her from Mrs. Norton (a

rememher the linea of Howard, 
which once you read to me in my 
ivy bower?* 

Id the diapoaition of what be- 
loDgB to me, I have CDdeavoured 
to do every thing in the justest 
and beat manner Icould think of: 
putting myself in my relations 
places, and in the greater points, 
ordering my matters, as if no mis- 
understanding had happened. 

I hope they mil not think much 
of some bequests where wanted, 
and where due from my gratitude: 
but if they should, what is done, 
iadone; and I cannot now help it. 
Yet I must repeat, that I hope, I 
hope, 1 have pleased every oue of 
them. For I would not, on any 
account, have it thought, that, 
in my last disposition , anything 




. should have had place 
in a mind that is so truly A'ee (as I 
will presume to say) from all re- 
sentment, that it now overflows 
with gratitude and blessings for 
the good I have received, althongh 
it be not all that ray heart wished

thatlwas not favoured with more, 
what is it but an hardship of half 
a year, against the mnsi indulgent 
goodness of eighteen years and 
an half, that ever was shewn to a 
daughter? 
My cousin, you tell me, thinks 
was off my guard, and that I was 
taken at some disadvantage. In- 
deed, my dear, I was not. Indeed 
I gave no room for advantage to 
he taken of me. 1 hope, one day, 
that will be seen, it I have the 
justice done me which Mr. Belford 

I should hope, that my cousin 
hasnottaken the liberties, which 
you, (by an observation nut, in. 
geueral, unjnet) seem to charge 
him with. For it is sad to think, 
that the generality of that sex 
should make so light of crimes, 
which they justly hold so unpar- 
donable in their own most in- 
timate relations of ours — yet 
cannot conimitthem without doing 
such injuries to other families aa 
they thiuk themselves obliged to 
resent unto death, when offered

jaar penitence; your ill health; 
your virtue, though once betrayed, 
and basely used ; he then read to 
them Mr. Lovelace's letter, a most 
contrite one indeed*; and your 
ir^ft-sDu/eii answer**; for that was 
what he justly called it; and he 
treated as it deserved Mr. Brand's 
officious information (of which, 1 
had before heard, he had made 
them ashamed) by representations 
fonnded upon inquiries made by 
Mr. Alston***, whom he had pro-

quaint himself with your manner

dear, adi'm," are you words —

your mamma, weeping, and clasp- 
■-ig her hands. 

Dearmadam, said your brother, 
e so good as to think you have

Yet your siater seemed af- 

Your uncle Harlowe, wiping 
bis eyes, O cousin, said he, if one 
thonghtthe poor girl was really so 



ill 

She mmt, said your uncle An- 
tony. This is written to her pri- 
vate friend. God forbid she should 
be quite lostl 

Your uncle Harlowe wished they 
did not carry their resentments 

I begged, for Kod's sake, wring- 
ing my hands, and with a bonded 
knee, that they would permit me 
to go up to you; eugagmg to give 
them a faithful account of the way 

{ou were in. But I was chidden 
y your brother; and this occa- 
sioned some angry words between 
him and Mr. Morden. 

I beheve , sir, I believe, madam, 
said your sister , to her father and 
mother, we need not trouble my 
cousin to read any more. It does 
but grieve and disturb you. My 
sister Clary seems to be ill: I think, 
if Mrs. Norton were permitted to 
go up to her, it would be right. 
Wickedly as she has acted, ifshe 
be truly penitent — 

Here she stopt; and every one 
being silent, 1 stood up once more, 
aud besought them to let lue govj

and then i offered to read a pas- 
sage or two in your letter to me of 
the 24th. Butlwastakeu up again 
by your brother; and this occa- 
sioned still hicber words bctneen 
the colonel and him. 

Your mother, hoping to gain 
upon your infleiible brother , and 
to divert the anger of the two 
gentlemen from each other, pro- 
poHcd that the colonel should pro- 
ceed in reading the minutes he 
had taken from yout letter. 

He accordingly read, "Of your 
resuming your pen; that you 
thought you bad taken your last 
farewell; and tlie reet of that very 
affecting passage, in which you 
are obliged to break off more than 
once and afterwards to take an 
airing in a chair." Your brother 
and sister were affected at this; 
and he had recourse to his saxiS- 
box. And where you comfort Miss 
Howe, and aay, "You shall be 
happy;" Itifi more, said he, than 
Bbe will let any body elae be. 

Your sister called you, aweet 
eoul! but with a low voice: then 



affected by your pathetic grief 
but that it was your talent. 

The colonel then went on to the 
good effect your airing had upon 
you; to your good wiBhea to Miaa 
Howe and Mr. Hickman; aud to 
your concluding sentence, that 
when the happy life you wished to 
her cornea to be wound up, she 
may be as calm aud as easy at 
quitting it, as you hope in G ' 
you shall be. Your mother co 
aot stand this; but lettred ti

comer of the room, and sobbed, 
and wept. Your father for a few 
minutes could not speak, though 
he seemed inclined to say aoine' 

Your uncles were also both af' 
fected ; — but your brother went 
round to each; and again reminded, 
yoiu' mother that she had olbw 
children: what was there, he said, 
ID what was read, but the result 
of the talent you had of movhij 
the passions? and he blamed them 
for choosing to hear read what 
they knew their abused induIgenoK

a value for the family, or for this

Both your uncles supported this

Your brother observed, in his

to approve of it. But your brother 
dashed all. I hope, sir, said he, 
to bis father; I hope, madam, to 
his mother; that you irill not 
endeavour to recover a faulti 



ever my sister Clary darkens thes^ 
doors again, I never will. I will 
set out, madam, the same hour 
you go to London (on such an er- 
rand) to Edinburgh; and there 
I will reside; and try to forget 
that I have relations in England 
so near and so dear as you arenow 
all to me. 

Good God, said the colonel, 
what a declaration is this ! — And 
BUppoHe, sir, and suppose, ma- 
dam, [turning to your father and 
mother] this slimild be the case, 
whether is it better, think you, 
that you should loae for ever such 
a daughter aa my cousin Clarv, or 
that your sou should go to Ediu- 
hurgh, and reside there upon an 
estate which will be the better for 
for hia residence upon it. 

Youi' brother's passionate be- 
haviour hereupon is hardly to be 
described, ile reaented it aa pro- 
moting an alienation of the aaec-', 
tian oftbe family to him. Avdto' 



such a height wei'e resentments 
carried, every one siding with 
him, that the colouel, with hands 
and eyes lifted up, cried ont, what 
hearts of Sint am 1 related to! —

The colonel turned from . 
to draw out his handkerchief, and 
could not for a minute spealb Tbe 
eyea of every one but the hard- 
hearted brother, caught tosM 
from his. 

But then turning to them (with 
the more indignation, asitseemsd, 
as he had been obliged to ibews 
humanity, which, bowever, M 
bravo heart should be asbaiiHJ 
of) I leave ye all, said he, fit 
company for one another. Iwill 
never open my lips to any of you 
more upon this suDJeet. I willin-

And saying this, he burned 
of the room, went into the oOOit- 
yard, and ordered his horse. 

Mr. Antony Hariowe went

of you all) that I will not again

of US one word to the other. At 
last she broke HJIence, asking me, 
if you were really and indeed bo 
illasit wasiaid you were? 

I answered in the affirmative; 
and would have shewn her your 
laat letter; but she declined Boe- 
ing it. 

Iwould fain have procured from 
her the favour of a line to yon, 
with her hleaaing. 1 asked, what 
was intended by your brother and 
sister? would nothine satisfy them 
but your final reprobation? — I 
insinuated, how easy it would be, 
did not your duty and humility 

fovem you, to make yourself in- 
ependent as to circumstances; 
but that nothing but a blessing, a 
last blesaing, was re quests Q by 
you. And many other things I 
urged in your behalf. The fol- 
lowing brief repetition of what she 
was pleased to say in answer to 
TQJ pleas, will give you a notion 
of it all; and of the present aitua- 
tionof tbings. 

She said, "She was very un- 
happy! — She had lost the little 
authority she once had over her 
other children, through one child's 
failing; and all iuSuence over Mr. 
Harlowe and bis brothers. Your 
father, she said, had besought her 
to leave it to hhn to take his own 
methods with you: and (as she 
valued him) to take no step in 
your favour nnknown to him and 
your uncles: yet she owned, that 
they were too much governed by 
your brother. They would, how- 
ever, give way in time, she know, 
toazeeoadliaitio^i: theydeaigaed| 



) other ; for they all still loved 



you. 

"Your brother and sister, she 
owned, were very jealousof your 
coming into favour aeain: yet 
could but Mr. Morden have kept 
his temper, and stood her son's 
first sallies, who (having alwayi 
had the family grandeur in view) 
had carried bis resentment h 
high, that be knew not how to 
descend, the conferences, so ab- 
ruptly broken off just now, wonid 
have endedmoTO happily; for tlut 
she had reason to think, that a 
few concessions on your part, 
with regard to your grandfatlier'i 

gaging for your submission 
from pro/ier motives, would bars 
softened them all. 

"Mr. Brand's account of your 
intimacy with the friend of the 
obnoxious man, she said, had, Sit 
very unhappy effectsr 
for before that she had gainea 
ground ; but afterwardi 
dared not, nor indeed had inclina- 
tion, to open her lips in youi be- 
half. Your continued intimaey 
with that Mr. Belford was wholly 
unaccountable, and as wholly ii 
excusable. 

"What made the wished-fbi 
reconciliation, she said, more dif- 
ficult, was, first, that you yooi- 
self acknowledged yourself «^ 
honoured (and it was too wdl 
known, that it was ^our own fault 
that you ever were m thi 
BO great a profligate) ; 
quence, that tbeu- and yoor dl>-<

aecDte the wretch. Nert, that the 
pardon &nd bleaaing hoped for, 
mnst probably be Btteuiftd with 
TOnr marriage to the man they 
hate, and who hates them as 
much: very dia agreeable circum- 
stances, she said, I must allow, to 
found a reconciliation upon. 

"As to her own part, she must 
needs say, thatifthere were ajiy 
hope that Mr. Lovelace would 
become a, reformed man, the letter 
her cousin Morden had read to 
them from him to you, and the 
justice (as she hoped it was) he 
did your chamcter, though to his 
own condemnation (Mb family 
and fortunes being unexception- 
able) and all his relatioua earnent 
to be related to you, were argu- 
ments that would have weight 
with her, could they have any 
with your father and uncles." 

To my plea of your illness. 
" She could not but flatter herself, 
she answered, that it was from 
lowness of spirits, and temporary 
d^ection. A young creature, she 
■Bid, so very considerate as you 
naturally were, and fallen so low, 
must have enough of that. Should 
"^ey lose you, which God forbid! 
Bcene would then indeed be 
iy changed; for then those 
moat reaen ted, would be 



brance, and your unhappy eiTor 
woald be quite forgotten. 

" She wished you would put 
yourself into your cousin's protec- 
tion entirely, and have notbiug 
more to say to Mr. Belford." 

And I would recommend it

your most serious consideration, 
my dear Hiss Clary, whether now, 
aa your cousin (who is your 
trustee for your grandfauier's 
estate) is come, you should not 
give over all thoughta of Mr. 
Lovelace's intimate friend far 
your executor; more eipetnally, 
as that gentleman's interferius m 
the concerns of your family, 
ahould the sad event take place 
(which ray heart aches but to 
think of) might be attended with 
those consequences which you are 
so desirous, in other cases, to ob- 
viate and prevent. And suppose, 
my dear young lady, yon were to 
write one letter more to each of 
your unelea, to let them know 
how ill you are — and to ask their 
advice, and offer to be governed 
by it, in relation to the dispoaition 
ofyour estalo and effects? — Me- 
thinks I wish you would. 

1 find they will send you up a. 
large part of what has been re- 
ceived from that estate , since it 
was yours; together with your cur- 
rent cash, which you left behind 
you: and this by your cousin 
Morden , for fear you should have 
contracted debta which may make 
you nneasy. 

They seem to expect, that you 
will Wish to live at your grand- 
father's house, in a private man-

Nevertheless, in reading it, she

complained; if 1 may say cnm-

She was very much affected at

she , a long and not very pleasing 
letter from my dear Mrs. Norton. 
It will soon be in your bands. I 
am advised against appointiug 
you to the office you have so kind-

choice will have no odd appearance 
to them: but it is now too late to 
alterit, if I would. 

I woidd fain write an answer to 
it, continued she: but I have no

aa he finds, that she gave you 
advantage over her. But he for- 
beara to enter further into this 
subject, he says, till he has the 
honour to see her; and the rather, 
as she seems so much determined 
agatDst you. However, he cannot 
but say, that he thinks you a 
gallant man, and aman of sense; 
and that you have the reputation 
of being thought a generous man 
in every instance but where the 
aei is concerned. In gurJi, he 
owns, that you have taken inex- 
cusable liberties. And he is sorry 
to say, that there are very few 
young men of fortune but who 
allow themselves in the same. 
Both sexes, he observes , too much 
love to have each other in their 
power; yet he hardly ever knew 
manor woman, who was very fond 
of power, make a right use of it. 

"If she be so absolutely deter- 
mined against marrying you, as 
she declares she is. he hopes, he 
says, to prevail upon her to take 
(as soon as her health will permit) 
a little tour abroad with him, as 
what will probably establish it; 
since travelling is certainly the 
best physic for all those disorders 
wbicb owe their rise to grief or 
disappointment. An absence of 
two or three years will endear her 
to every one, on her return, and

And so, my friends, said she, have 
I heard of a patient who actually 
died, while five or six principal 
physicians were in a consultation, 
and not agreed upon what name 
to give his distemper. The patient 
was an emperor, Uie Emperor Jo- 
seph, 1 think. 

1 asked, if I should write to her 
cousin, aa he knew not how ill she 
was, to hasten up? 

By no means, she said ; since, if 
he were not already set out, she 
was persuaded that she should be 
so low by the time he could receive 
my letter, and come, that his pre- 
sence would but discompose and 
hurry her, and afflict him. 

I hope, however, she is uot so 
very near her end. And without 
saymgany more to her, when I 
retired, I wrotetoColonelMorden, 
that if he expects to see his beloved 
cousin alive, he must lose no time 
in setting oat. I sent this letter 
by his own servant.

Tarn urgencj of the case, and 
the opportunity by your servant, 
will Bufiiciently apofogize for this 
troahle from a stranger to your 
person; who, however, is not a 
stranger to yonr merit. 

I understand you are employ- 
ing your good offices, with the 
parents of MissClarissft Uarlowe, 
and other relations, to reconcile 
them to the most meritorious 
daughter and kinswoman that 
ever family had to boast of. 

Generously as this ia intended 
by you, we here have too much 
reason to think all your aolici- 
todea on this head will be un- 
necessary: for it is tlie opinion of 
every one who has the honour of 
being admitted to her preseoce, 
that she cannot live over three 
days: so that if you wish to see 
her alive, you must lose no time to 
come up. 

She knows not that I write. 1 
had done it sooner, if 1 had had 
the least doubt that before now 
dhe would not have received from 
yon some news of the happy 
effects of your kind mediation in 
bar behalf. I am, Sm,

three or four times a day, re-

ride back; and, in view of Ui-

give you an idea of the strength 
of that imijatience, which! cannot 
avoid suffering to break out upon 
my servants , 1 h ad no sooner dis- 
patched Will, than I took horse 
to meet him on his return. 

In order to give him time, 1 
loitered abont on the road , riding 
up iMs lane to the one highway, 
down thai to the other, just as my 
horse pointed; all the way curaing 
my very being; and ihoiigh so 
lately looking duwn upon all the 
world, wishing to change condi- 
tionB with the poorest beggar that 
cried to me for charity as I rode 
by him — and throwing him 
money, in hopes to obtain Dj his 
prayers the blessing my heart 
pants after. 

After i had sauntered about an 
hour or two (which seeped three 
or four tedious ones) fearing I had 
alipt the fellow, 1 inquired at 
every turnpike, whether a servant 
in Bucb a livery had not passed

in so short ft compass! 

Yet all this time, though lonj

It was communicated to me by 
Mrs. Lovick; who had it to copy 
for me; but it was not to be de-

theless I must, in JQStice to my 
«wD gratitude, declare, that there 
woe a time, could you have been 
permitted to come, without incar- 
ring displeasure from those whose 
esteem it is necessary for you to 
cultivate and preserve, that your 
presence and comfortinga would 
have been balm to my wounded 
Blind. But were yon now, even by 
consent, and with re conciliatory 
tidings, to come, it would but add 
to your grief; and the sight of one 
Ibo dearly love, so happiTv fraught 
iritb good news, might but draw 
me baxk to wishea I have had 
sreat straggles to get above. And 
\et me tell you for your comfort,' 
that I have not left undone anyi 
tiling that ought to be done, either ' 



respecting mind ot person; no, not 
to the minutest preparation: so J 
that nothing is left lor imt to do 
for me. Every one has her direc- 
tion as to the last offices. — And 
my desk, that I now write upon — 
0! mv dearest Mrs. Norton, all is 
provided! — All is ready! And all 
will be as decent as it should be ! 

And pray let my Miss Uowe 
know, that by tlie time you will re- 
ceive this, and she ymir significa- 
tion of the contents of it, it will, in 
all probability^ be too late for W 
to do me the mestimable favour, 
aa I should once have thought it, 
to see me. Ood will haee no rivali 
in the hearts of Ikose lie sancti/tcn. 
By various methods he deaacna 
all other sensations, or rather ab- 
sorbs them all in the love of him. 

I shall nevertheless love you, 
my mamma Norton, and my Miss 
Uowe, whose love to me has passed 
the love of inoDJCTi, to my latest 
hour! — But yet, 1 am now above 
thequick sense of those pleasures, 
which once most delighted me; 
and once more 1 say, that I do not 
wish to see objecta so dear to me, 
which might bring ine back again 
iuto sense, and rival my siipnam 
loi:e.

it might have very happy effects 
upon the geutiemftn. 

I have DO lurking reBentment, 
air, said she — this is not st time 
for resentment; and you will be 
the readier to believe me, whenl 
can aseure you, (looking at me) 
that even what I have most re- 
joiced in, the truly friendly love 
that has so long aubsisted between 
my Misa Howe and her Clariasa, 
although to my last gasp it will 
be the dearest to me of all that 
IB dear in this life, has already 
abated of its fervour; has already 
given place to aupremer fervours : 
and ahall the remembrance of Mr. 
Lovelace 'a persona/ insults, which, 
IbteBs6o£ never corrupted that 
Toind which Aer friendship so much 
delighted, be atrongpr in these 
hours with me, than the remem- 
brance of a love as pure aa the 
human heart ever bo aa ted? Tell, 
therefore, the world, if you pleaae, 
ftnd, (if, Mr. Belfbrd, you think 
what I aaid to you before, not 
atrong enough) tell the poor man, 
that 1 not only forgive him, but 
have such earnest wishes for the 
good of his BOul, and that from 
considerations of its immortality, 
that could my penitence avail for 
more sins than my own, my last 
tear should fall for him by whom 
I die! 

Our eyes and hands expressed 
for us both, what our lips could 
not utter. 

Say not, then, proceeded she, 
nor let it be said, that my resent- 
ments are unsubdued I — And jet 
these eyes, lifted up to heaven aa 
to tbc truth of TOhat 1 have 



aaid, shaU never, if T can kelp 
it, behold him more! — For do 
you not consider, sirs, how short 
my time is; what much more im- 
portant subjects I have to employ 
it upon; and how unable 1 should 
be (so weak as I am) to contend 
even with the avowed penitence 
of a person in strong health, go- 
verned by paaaious unabated, and 
always violent? — And no 
hope, you will never urge me i 
on this subject. 

The minister said it were pi^ 
ever to urge this ptea again. 

You see, Lovelace, that I did, 
not forget the office of a inend, ia 
endeavouring to prevail ujKin hev 
to give you her last forgiveneu< 
personally. And I hope, as t*" 
is GO near her eud, you will i 
invade her in her last hours; sir 
she must be ejtremel^ disco 

posed at such an interview; a 

it might make her leave the world' 
the sooner for it. 

This reminds me of an exprea* 
sion which she used on your ba^' 
bai'ous hunting her at Smith's, on 
her return to her lodgings; and 
that with a serenity unexampled 
(asMrs. Lovicktoldme, consider- 
ing the occasion, and the trc 
given her by it, and her indispo- 
sition at the time): He will not 
let me die decently! said the ao'. 
geUc sufferer. — He will not lei, 
me enter into my Maker'H pra- 
sence, with the composure that 
is required in entering into the 
drawing-room of an earthly 
prince. 

1 cannot, however, forbear ta 
^ivish that the Leaveoly cteatorft

eonld have prevailed upon herBelf, 
in these her last hours, to see 
yon; and that for my sake, as 
■well as jours: for although I am 
deterraitied never to be guilty ol 
thecrimes, which, till witEin these 
few past weeks have blackeued 
mj former life ; and for which, at 
present, I moat heartily hate roj- 
aelf; yet should I be leaa appre- 
hensive of a relapse , if (wrought 
upon by the solemnity which suth 
an interview must have been at- 
tended with) you had become a 
reformed man; for no devil do 
Ifear, but one in your shape. 



It is now eleven o'clock at night. 
The tady, who retired to rest an 
hour ago, is, as Mrs. Lovick tells 
ni^ in a sweet slumber. 

I will close here. I hope I shall 
find her the better for it in the

carried the lady's letter. The 
Htnpid fellow, being bid to make 
haste with it, and letnm as soon 
as poaaible, staid not till Miss 
Howe had it, she being at the dia- 
tanceof five miles, although Mrs, 
Howe would have had him atay, 
and sent a man and horse pur< 
poaelywith it to her daughter. 

Thb poor lady is just recovered 
from a fainting fit, which has left 
her at deatffa door. Her late 
tranquillity and freedom from 
pain, seemed but a lighlening, aa 
Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith

By my faith, Lovelace, I bad 
rather part with all the friends I 
have in the world, than with this 
lady. I never knew what a vir- 
tuous, a holy friendship, aalmay 
call mine U> her, was before. But 
to be BO neia to it, and to be 
obliged to forego it ao soon, what 
anaBlictiou! Yet, thank Heaven,

But 'twould be barbarous not to

She has sent for the divine who

death, in the same breath, with a 
view, no doubt, to distract me. 
How familiarly dost tfaou use the 
words, dying, dimness, tremor! 
Never did any mortal ring so 
many changes on bo few Sella, 
Thy true lather, I dare swear, waa 
a batcher, or an undertaker, by 
the delight thou seemest to take 
in sccnea of death and horror. 
Thy barbarous reflection, that 
thou loaest her not by thine own 
fault, is never to be forgiven. 
Thoa hast but one way to atone 
for the torments thou giveat me, 
and that is, by sending me word 
that she is better,and will recover. 
Whether it be true or not, let me 
be told so, and 1 will ^a abroad 
rejoicing and believing it, and my 
wishes and imagination ahall 
make out all the rest. 

If Bhe live but one year, that 
I may acquit myself lo myself 
(no matter for the world!) that 
her death is not owing to me, 1 
will compound for the rest. 

Will neither vows nor prayers 
save her! I never prayed in my 
life, put all the years of it to- 
gether, aa I have done for thia 
fortnight paat: and I have most 
eiucercly repented of all my base- 
ness to her — and will nothing 
do? 

But after all, if she recovernot,

The effect this letter had on 
the lady , who is so near the end

MrB.Lovick to make many breaks 
in reading it, and many changes

She said, her dear friend was 

earnest for a line or two, that 
she fain would write, if she could: 
and she tried , but to no purpose; 
She could dictate, however, ebo 
believed; and desired Mrs. Lovicfc 
would take pen aodpaper. Which 
she did, and then ahe dictated to 
ker. I would have withdrawn; 
but at her desire staid. 

She wandered a good deal, at 
first. She took notice that she 
did. And when ahe got into a 
little train, not pleasing herself, 
she apologized to Mi's, Lovick 
for makin? her begin again and 
again; and said, that the third 
time should go, let it be as it 
would. 

She dictated the farewell part, 
without hesitation ; and when she 
came to the blessing and sub- 
ecriptiou, she took the pen, and 
dropping on her knees, supported

He was impatient to attendher,

of being one of the finest 

in England. 

She teas so, replied I, a very

to have confirmed those promises : 
for her features are so regular

we went up softly together. 

We beneld the lady, in a

I told you before, in her virgin

She had been a mother to her, 
and she would delight herself in

One faded cheek rested upon 
the good woman's bosom, the 
kindly warmth of which had over- 
spread it withafaint, but charm- 
ing flush; the other paler, and 
hollow, as if already iced over by 
deatb Her hands white as the

more transparently blue than 
everlbad seen even hers, (veins 
so soon, alas I to be choaked 
up by the congealment of that 
purple stream, which alreadv so 
languidly creeps, rather than 
flows throu^;h them!) her hands 
hanging lifelessly, one before her, 
the other grasped by the right 
hand of the kind widow, whose 
tears bedewed the sweet face 
which her motherly bosom sup- 
ported , though unfelt by the fair 
sleeper; and either iuaunsibly to

ff^od Norton. 
[, madam, send oiy servant

', I thank you. It will 
reach the dear woman too soon 
(as she will think) by the post. 

I told her, this was not post 
day. 

Ib it Wednesday still, saidsbe? 
Bless me! I know not bow the time 
foes: bntvery tediously, 'tis plain. 
And now I think I must soon take 
to my bed. All will be most con- 
veniently, and with least trouble, 
over there — will it not, Mrs. 
LovickV — I think, sir, turning to 
me, I have left nothing to these, 
Iftst incapacitating hours. Nothing 
either to say, or to do. IblessGod, 
I have not. If I Aiiif, boiv unhappy 
shouldlbe? Can you, sir, remind 
me of any thing neceaaary to be 
done or aaid to make yonr office 

If, madam, yoar cousin Morden 
should come, you would be glad 
to see him, I presume? i 

1 am too weak to wish to aee my I 



293 

cousin uow. It would but dis- 
compoae me, and him too. Yet, if 
be come while I can see, I v>itl see 
him, were it but to thank him for 
former favours, and for bia present 
kind intentions to me. Has any 
body been here from him? 

lie has called, and will be here, 
madam, In half an houi; but he 
feared to surprise you. 

Nothing can surprise me now, 
eicept my mamma were to favour 
me with her last blessing in person. 
That would be a welcome surprise 
to me even yet. But did my 
cousin come purposely to town to 

Yes, madam. Itookthehberty 
to let him know, by a liue last 
Jlonday, bow ill you were. 

You are very kind, sir, I am, 
and have been greatly obliged to 
yon. But I think I ahall be pained 
to aee him now, because he will be 
concerned to aee me. And yet, as 
ill as I shall presently

, the 



chide me, very probably, and I 
cannot bear chiding now. Perhaps 
[leaning upon Mrs. Lovick and 
.Mrs. Smith] 1 can walk into the 
neit apartment to receive him. 

She motioned to rise; but naa 
ready to faint again, and forced 
to sitstill. ■ 

The colonel was in a perfect 
agitation behind the screen, to 
hear this discourse ; and twice, 
unseen by his cousin, was coming 
from it towardsher; but retreated, 
for fear of surprising her taii 
much,

For she heard somebody step

it to be me; her hearing beingi

I told her, I believed be was; 
and sbe said, We most make the

for he loved me dearly once. Pray

that he might not see what was

what she had said about it, was 
determined to take no notice of it. 
He folded the angel in his arms 
aa she sat, dropping down on one 
knee; for, supporting herself 
upon the two elbows of the chair, 
ahe attempted to rise, but could

according to the wili I have 
written. Mr. Belford will eieuse 
me: but it was in truth more ne- 
cessity than choice, that made me 
thinkof giving him the trouble he 
so kindly aocepta. Had I had the 
happiness to see you, my cousin 
— aoooar — or to know that you 
stili honoured me with your re-- 
gard — I shontd not have had the 
aasuruice to ask this favour of 
lam. — But — though the friend 
of Mr. Lovelace, he is a man of 
honour, and he will make peace 
rather than break it And, my 
dear cousin, let me beg of you — 
to eontribute your part to it — 
and remember, that, while I have 
nearer relations than my cousin 
Alorden, dear as you are , and al- 
ways were to me, you haveno title 
to avenge my wrongs upon him 
who ihas been the occasion of 
them. But 1 wrote to you my 
mind on this subject, and my 
reasons; and 1 hope 1 need not 
filther urge them. 

ImustdoMr.Lovelaceso much 
justice, answered he, wiping hie 
eyes, as to witness, how sincerely 
be repents him of his ungrateful 
baseness to you, and how ready 
he is to make you all the amends 
in his power. He owns Au nicked- 
neea, and ynur merit. If he did 
not, 1 could not pass 
though you kace nearer relations: 
for, my dear cousin, did not your 
gfaudfather leave me in trust for 
yon? And should 1 think myuelf 
concerned for your fortune ' 

not for your honour? But 
he is so desirous to do you jn 
I have the less to say; and you 



295 

may make yourself entirely eaay 
on that account. 

I thank you, thank you, sir, 
said she; all is now as I wished: 
but I am *ery faint, very weak. I 
am sorry I cannot hold up; that 
I cannot better deserve the honour 
of this visit; but it will not be — 
and saying this, she sunk back in 
' 'r chair, and was silent. 

Hereupon we both withdrew, 
leaving word, that we would he at 
the Bedford Head, if any thing 
eitraordinary happened. 

We bespoke a litUe repast, 
having neither of us dined; and, 
while it was getting ready, you 
may guess at the subject of our 
discourse. Both joined in lament 
tation for the lady's desperate 
state: admired her manifold ex- 
cellencies: severely condemned 
, and her friends. Yet to 
ig him into better opinion of 
you , I read to him some passages 
from your last letters, which 
shewed your concern for the 
wrongs you had done her, and 
your deep remorse: and be said, 
It was a dreadful thing to labour 
under the sense of a guilt so irre- 
mediable. 

We procured Mr. &oddard [Dr. 
H. not being at home) once more 
to visit her, and call upon us in 
his return. He was so good as to 
do so; but he tarried withhernot 
five minutes; and told us, That 
she was drawing on apace; that 
he feared she would not live till 
morning; and that she wished to 
see Colonel Morden directly. 

The colonel made excuses whex.% 
none weve uteifti', wii "iuawfii.

we were both admitted. We ob- 
served in her, as soon as we en' 
tered, BtroDgr sjmptoa 
approaching aissolu tio n . 
Btandinc What the women had 
flattered ub witii from her last 
night's tranquillity. The colonel 
and I, each loth to saj what we 
thought, looked upon one another 
with melancholy countenances. 

The colonel told her. He should 
send a servant to her nncle An- 
tony's for some papers he had left 
tibere; and asked, If she had any 
commands that way? 

She thought not, sheaaid, speak- 
ing more inwardly than she did 
the day before. She had indeed 
a letter ready to be sent to her 
good Norton; and there was a re- 
quest intimated in it: but it was 
time enough, if the request were 
signified to those whom it con- 
cerned when all was over. How- 
ever, it might be scut then by 
the servant who was going thati 
way. Andshecausedit to begiven 
to the coionelforthat purpose. 

Her breath being very short, 
she desired another pdlow. Having 
two before, this made her in a 
manner sit up in her bed ; and she 
■poke then with more distinct- 
ness; and, seeing us greatly con- 
cerned, forgot her own suderings 
to comfort us; and a charming 
lecture she gave us, though a brief 
one, upon the happinessofatimely 
preparation, and upon the hazards 
L.0f a late repentance, when the 
■niod, as she observed, was bo| 
■Bucb weakened, as weil as the 
'ipdy, as to render a poor 30ul| 









, for herself On the con- 
trarv, rejoice with me, that all ray- 
worldly troubles are so near their 
end. Believe me, sirs, that I 
would not, if 1 might, choose to 
live, although the pTeasantest part 
of my life were to come over again : 
and yet eii/lileen ffearg of it, out of 
nineteen, have been uer^ pleasant. 
To be so much exposed to tempta- 
tion, and to be so liable to fail in 
the trial, who would not rejoice, 
that all her dangers are over! — 
All I wished was pardon and bless- 
ing from mj dear parents. Easy 
as my departure seems to promise 
to be, it would have been still 



She then repeated her request, 
in the most earoest manner, to her 
cotisin, that he would not heiifhien 
her fault, by seeking to avenge 
her death ; to in; , that 1 would en- 
deavour to make up all breaches, 
and use the power 1 had with my 
friend, to prevent all future mis- 
chiefa frnm him, aa well as that 
which this trust might give me, to 
prevent any lo him. 

She made some eicuses to her 
ci'iwiVi, for having not been able to 
alter her will, to join him in the 
executorehip with me; and to tiie 
for the trouble she had given, and 
yet should give me.

DRAK JACK,

for«»^ MbreTiate 

i*-- }A, He 



yet wants to know every minute 
passage of Miss Harlowe's depar- 
ture. X et , why he should , I can- 
not see; for if she is^one, she is 
gone ; and who can help it? 

I never heard of such a woman 
in my life. What great matters 
has she suffered, that grief should 
kill her thus? 

I wish the poor fellow had nefer 
known her. From first to last, 
what trouble has she cost him! 
The charming fellow has been 
half lost to us ever since he pursaed 
her. And what is there in one 
woman more than another, for 
matter of that? 

It was well we were with him 
when your note came. Yo^ 
shewed your true friendship in 
your foresight. Why, Jack, the 
poor fellow was quite beside him- 
self — mad as any man ever was 
in Bedlam. 

Will brought him the letter just 
after we had joined him at the 
Bohemia Head; where he had left 
word at the Rose atKnightsbridge 
he should be; for he had been 
sauntering up and down, back- 
wards and forwards, expecting 
us , and his fellow. Will , as soon 
as he delivered it, got out of his 
way; and when he opened it,ne^ 
was such a pi^ce or scenery. He 
trembled like a devil at receiving 
it : fumbled at the seal , his &i^ 
in a palsy, like Tom Doleman'a: 
his hand shake, shake, shake, 
that he tore the letter in two, be- 
fore he could come at the con- 
tents: and, when he had read

aniug up and donn the room, 
id tbrowiog up the sash, and 
tiling it down and smiting hie 
rorehead with his double fist, with 
snch force as would have felled an 
ox, and stamping and tearing, 
that the landlord ran in, and 
faster out again. And this was 
the distraclion scene for some time. 
In vain waa all Tourville or 1 
could Bavto him. I offered once 
to take bold of his hands because 
he was going to do himself a mis- 
chief, as I believed, looking about 
for his pistols, which hehad laid 
upon the table , but which Will, 
had taken oat with him 



and he hit me a d— n'd dowse 
— the chops, as made my nose 
bleed. 'Twas well 'twaa fie; for 
I hardlj knew how to take it. 

Jemmy raved at him , and told 
him, How wicked it was in him, 
to be BO brutish to abuse a Iriend, 
and run mad for a woman. And 
then he said, he was sorry for it; 
and then Will ventured in with 
water and a towel; and the dog 
rejoiced, as I could see by hia 
look, that I /idi' it rather than he. 

And BO , by degrees we brought 
bim a little to his reason, and he 
promised to behave more like a 
man. And sol forgave him: and 
we rode on in the dark to here at 
Doleman's. And we all tried to 
ahame him out of his mad un- 
for we 



verse woman tooi and how could 
he help it¥ 

And you know, Jack, (aa we 
told him, moreover) that it was a 
shame to manhood, for a man, 
who had served twenty and twenty

As I promised bim that I would 
write for the particulars above 
said, I write this after all 
are gone to bed ! and the fel- 
low is to set out with it by 
day- break.

)fl the denuBe of tbis ad- 



mirable woman, whose soul is 
now rejoicing in the regioi "

lou may be glad to know the 
particulars of her happy exit. I 
will fry to proceed ; for all ie hush 
aud still; the family retired: but 
not one of them, and least of all 
her poor cousin , I dare say 

At four o'clock, as I meutioned 
in mj last, I was sent for down; 
and, as thou usedst to tike my de- 
scriptions, 1 will give thee tb4 
woeful scene that presented it- 
self to me, as I approached tho 

The colonel was the first that 
took my attention, kneeling oa 
the side of thebed, the lady's right 
band in both his with his face co- 
vered, bathing it with his i 
although she had been comfc . . ^, 
him, as the women since told me,, 
in elevated straius, but brokea) 
accents. 

On the other aide of the bed i 
the good widow; her face over-' 
whelmed with tears, leaning het 
head against the bed's head in a 
most disconsolate manner; 
turning her face to me as so 
she saw me, O, Sir. Belford, 
she, with folded hands — Th« 
dear lady — A heavy sob per- 
mitted her not to say more. 

I^Itb. Smith, with clasped fin*' 
gers, and uplifted eyes, asifim-' 
ploringhelp from the only power 
which could give it, was luieeling 
down by the bed's feet, tears m^ 
large drops trickling down hei 
cheeks. 
\ Het nurse was kneeling be- 



Etween the widow and Mra. Smith, I 
heranuB extended. In one hand 
she beld au ineffectual cordial, 
nrhicb she had just been offering | 
to her dying mistress; her face^ 
was swoln with weepine [though; 
lued to such sceuesas^is); and 
she turned her eyes towards me, 
&B if she called upon me, by tbem, 
to join in the helpless sorrow, a 
fresh stream bursting from tbcm 
as I approached the bed. 

The maid of the hanse with her 
foce upon her folded arms, as she 
stood leaning against the wain- 
scot, more audibly espreat her 
grief than any of the others. 

The lady had been silent a few 
minutes, and speechless as they 
thoaght, moving her lips without 
uttering a word; one hand, as J 
said, in her consin's. But when 
Mrs. Lorick on my approach pro- 
nounced my name, O! Mr. Bel- 
'ford, said she, with a faint in- 
ward voice, but very distinct 
nevertheless— Nowl — Now! [in 
broken periods she spoke] — I 
bless God for his mercies to his 
poor creature — will all soou be 
OTer — a few — a very few mo- 
ments — will end this strife — and 
I shall be happy. 

Comfort here, sir — turning her 
head to the colonel — comfort my 
cousin — see ! the blame — able 
kindness — he would not wish me 
to be happy — so soon/ 

Here she stopt, for two or three 
tninntes, earnestly looking upon: 
him: then resuming, My dearest 
cousin^ said she, be comforted — j

^ It is not so hard to die, as I be- 
lieved it to he! — The prepara- 
tion is the difficulty — I bless 
God, I have had time for that — 
the rest is worse to beholders, than 
to me ! — I am all blessed hope — 
hope itself. She looked what she 
-■■■'' '* .."."-^t smile beaming over 



After a short silence, Once more, 
my dear cousin, said she, butattll 
iu broken accents, commend me 
most dutifully to mj father and 
mother — there she stopt. And 
then proceeding — To my sister, 
to my brother, to my uncles — and 
tell them, 1 bless them with my 
parting breath ^ for all their 

Soodneas to me — even for their 
ispleaaure — I bless them —

She WAS silent for a few mo- 
ments, lifting up her eyes, and the 
hand her cousin held not between 
his. Then, deailil said she, 
where is Ihi/ fling ! [The wotdslre- 
member to have heard in the 
burial service read over my uncle 
and poor Belton]. And after a 
pause — It is good for me thai 1

Then turning towards ua, who 
were lost in speechless sorrow — 
O dear, dear gentlemen, said she,

motnonts: and then resuming —

She paused again, her breath 
giH) wing shorter; ana, after a few j 
mlnuttvi, And now, my dearest; 
oouiiin, give me your hand — j 
noartu* — still nearer — drawing I 
it towanls her; and she pressed it ^ 
with her dving lips — God protect !

I't^oeivo my best and most grateful , 
thanks -- and tell mv dear Miss'

to tell my wortliy Norton — she

now lowly in her fortunes^ a saint 
in heaven — tell them both, that I ! 
remember them with thankful 
blessings in my last moments! — ; 
And pray God to give them hap- [ 
piness here for many, many years, ' 
for the sake of their friends and 



lovers; and an heavenly crown 
hereafter; and such assurances of 
it, as I have, through the all-satis- 
fying merits of my blessed Ke- 
deemer. 

Her sweet voice and broken pe- 
riods, methinks, still fill my ears, 
and never will be out of my me- 
mory. 

After a short silence, in a more 
broken and faint accent — And 
you, Mr. Belford, pressing my 
hand, may God preserve you, and 
make you sensible of all your er- 
rors — you see, in me, how all 
ends — may you be — and down 
sunk her head upon her pillow, 
she fainting away, and drawing 
from us her hands. 

We thought she was then gone; 
and each gave way to a violent 
burst of grief. 

But soon shewing signs of re- 
turning life, our attention was 
again engaged; and I besought 
her, when a little recovered, to 
complete in my favour her half- 

g renounced blessing. She waved 
er hand to us both, and bowed 
her head six several times, as we 
have since recollected, as if dis- 
tinguishing every person present; 
not forgetting the nurse and the 
maid-servant; the latter having 
approached the bed, weeping, as 
it crouding in for the divine la^s 
last blessing; and she spoke w- 
tering and inwardly — Bless — 
bless — bless — you all — and — 
now — and now — [holding up 
her almost lifeless hands for the 
last time] Come — come — 
blessed Lord — Jescs! 
• And with these words, the last 



but half- pronounced, eipirert: — 
euchaatnile, such a charming se- 
renity overspreading her ewoet 
face at the imtant, as seenied to 
manifeet her eternal hMppineas al- 
ready begOD. 

Lovelace! — Bat I can write 



While warm, though pulse less, 
we pressed each her band with our 
lips; and then retired into the 
next room. 

We looked at each other, with 
intent to speak: but, as if one 
motdoQ governed, as one cause 
affected Doth, we turned away 
iilenl. 

The colonel aighed as if hia 
ieart would burst; at last, his face 
Bad bands uplifted, his back to- 
.vardame, GoodUeavim! said he 
tnhiiDBelt, support me! — And is 
itthuB,0 flower of nature! — Then 
jwosing — And must we no more 
: — Never mnrel — My blessed,

[•tJier words, which his sighs made 
'inarticulate; — and then, as if 
recollecting himself — Forgive 
me, sir! — Eicnae me, Mr. Bel- 
ford! And, aliding by me, Anon 
tl hope to see you, sir — and down 
■tatrs he went, and out of the 
bonse, leaving me a statue. 
When I recovered, 1 was ready 
to repine at what I Ihen called an 
niicanal dispensation; forgetting 
her nappy prcpuratioa, and stth 
happier departure; and that she 
bad bat drawn a common lot; 
tiiiunpfaing in it, and leaving be-

liappinesa, though equally certain 
that the lot wouldono day be their 

She departed exactly at forty 
mioutes after six o'clock, as by her 
watch on the table. 

And thus died Miss CLAuisiiA 
iliRLowB, in the blossom of her 
youth and beauty: and who, her 
tender ^ears considered, has not 
left behmd her her superior in ex- 
lensiveknowtedge, and watchful 
]irndence; nor hardly her equal 
for unblemished virtue, exemplary 
piety, sweetnessofmannm, dis- 
creet generosity, and true Cbrii- 
tlan charity: and these all set off 
by the most graceful modesty and 
humility; yet on all proper oc- 
casions, manifesting a noble pre- 
sence of mind , and true magnani- 
mity: so that she may he said to 
lave been not only an ornament 
to her sex, but to human nature. 

A better pen than mine may do 
her fuller justice. Thine, I mean, 
O Lovelace! For well dost thou 
know how much she excelled in 
the graces both of mind and per- 
son, natural and ac(|uired,all that 
is woman. And thou also canst 
best account for the causes of her 
immature death, through those 
calamities which in so short a 
space of time, from the highest 
pitch of felicity (every one in a 
manner adoring her,) broneht ber

it would be presumption to have 
asked for it: and to-morrow a

Your uncle Harlowe will also 
write, and (I doubt not) in the 
kindest terms: for they are all ex- 
tremely alarmed and troubled at 
the dangerous way your doctor 
represents yon to be in ; as wel! as 
delighted with the character he

I WILL now take np the account 
of our proceedings, from my 
letter of last night, which con- 
tained the dying words of this in- 
comparable lady. 

As soon as we had seen the last 
scene closed (bo blessedly for her- 
selN) we left the body to the care 
of the good woman, who, ac- 
cording to the orders she had 
given them that very night, re- 
moved her into that last house 
which she had displayed bo much 
fortitude in providiug. 

In the moming between seven 
and eight o'clock, according to 
appointment, the colonel came to 
me here. He was very much in- 
disposed. We went together, ac- 
companied hy Mrs. Lovick and 
Mrs. Smith, into the deceased's 
chamber. We could not help 
taking a view of the lovely 
corpse, and admiring the charm- 
ing serenity of her noble aspect. 
The women declared, the^ «.«*«=

Abandoning, therefore, a sub-

touch upon, (for I hope, at the

yon, sir, that my next motive for

to forego any active " " ' ' 
(which may endangi

For, ought au innocent man to

guilty one baa been long inured to

the arts of offence? 

You wonld notarrogateto your-

Leave then the poor wretch to 
the divine justice. Let your sister's 
fault die with her. At least, let it 
not be revived in blood. Idfe is a 
short stage where longest. Alittle 
time hence, the now green head 
will be grey, if it lives this little 
time: and if Heaven will afford 
him time for repentance, why 
should not jou.* 

Then think, mybrother, what 
will be the consequence to your 
dear parents, if the guilty wretch 
who has occasioned to them the 
loss of a daughter, should likewise 
deprive them of their best hope, 
an only son, more worth in the 
family account than several 
daughters? 

Would you add, mybrother, to 
those distresses which you hold 

Jour sister so ineicuaable for 
aving (although from involuutary 
and undesigned causes) given? 

Seek not then, I beseech yon, 
to extend the evil consequences of 
your sister's error. His conscience 
when it shall please God to touch 
it, will be sharper than your 

I have Qtill another motive for 
writing to you in this solemn 
manner: it is, to entreat you to 
watch over your passions. The 
principal fault I knew you to ba 
guilty of, is, the violence of your 
temper when you think yourself 
in the right; which you would 
oftener be , but for that very vi 
lence.

THE HISTORY OF 



It is easy then to judge what 
must be their grief and eurpriae 
on receiving the fatal newa which 
the letter llRrry seat in to them 
commnnicated. 

He Btuid there long enough to 
find the whole house in confuaion; 
the Bervanta running different 
ways ; lamenting and wringing 
their handa as tbeyran; the feniale 
BerrantB particularly; as if some- 
body (poor Mrs. Harlowe, no 
douot, and perhaps Mrs. Herrey 
too) were in fits. 

Every one wag in each disorder, 
that he coold get no commauds, 
nor obtain any notice of himself. 
The servants seemed more inclined 
to execrate than welcome him — 
O master! young man! cried 
three or four together, what dis- 
mal tidings have you faroughtl 
They helped him , at the very first 
word, to his horaej which with 
great oivility they had put up on 
hisarriTal: and he went to an inu; 
and pursued oq foot his way to 
Mrs. Norton's; and finding her 
come to town, left the letter he 
carried down for her with her 
(a fine youth); who, when he 
heard the fatal news, burst out 
intoafiood of tears^first lament- 
ing the lady's death, and then 
crying out, what, what, would 
become of his poor mother! — 
How would she support herself, 
when she should find, on her ar- 
rival in town, that the dear lady, 
who was 80 deservedly the darling 
of lier heart, was no more! 

He proceeded to Miss Howe's 
with the letter for her. That lady, 
he was told, bad just given orders 




young man, a tenant's 
5t toXondon, to bring hajj 
of her dear friend's coir 
dition, and whether she shoiiU 
herself be encouraged, byanao 
count of her being still alive, tOT 
make hera visit; every thing braog 
ordered to be in readiness for hei 
going up, on his return with the 
news she wished and prayed fol 
with the utmost impatience. And 
Harry wasjust in time, to prerSnt , 
' setting out. 

the precaution to dwirt | 
to speak with Misa Howe's wona 
maid, and communicated t 
r the fatal tidings, that tb 
ght break them to her ) — 
lady. The maid herself w 
affected, that her old lady (vbo 
Harry said, seemed to be ««; 
where al once) came to see whi 
ailed her; and was herself • 
struck with the communicatiiOi 
that she was forced tositdowubi 
O the sweet creatnrt! 
said she — and is it come to tluil 
— O mypoorNaucyl — HowihaH 
1 be able to break the matter toinj 
Nancy! 

Mr. Hickman was in the hous^ 
He hastened in to comfort the oB' 
lady — but he could not restrt 
his own tears. He feared, 
said, when he was last in tovl^' 
that this sad event would l"~ 
happen : but little tbDueht itwo 
be so very soon I — but she i 
happy, I am sure, said thegooi 
gentleman. 

Mrs. Howe, when a Uttle n 
covered, went up, in order t 
break the news to her daughta 
She took Oie letter, andberaR"^^ 



in her hand. And thej ha.d 
caaion for the latter; for the' 
hoHBekeeper ho on came hurrying 
down into the kitchen, ber face 
orerapread with tears— her young 
mlBtresa had fainted away , she 
said — nor did she wonder at it — 
never did there live a, lady more 
deEervjng of general admiration 
and lamentation, than Misa Cla- 
rissa Haclowe! and never waa 
there a stronger friendahip dis- 
solved by death than bctw^een her 
young lady and her. 

She hurried with a lighted wax 
candle , and with feathers, to burn 
oitder the noae of her young mia- 
tresa; which shewed that she con- 
tinned in fits. 

Mr. Hickman afterwards , with 
his ntnal humanity , directed that 
Harry ahonld be taken care of all 
night; it being then the clone of 
the day. He asked him after my 
health. He eipreased himself ei- 
cessively afHicted, as well for the 
death of the most eiccllent of wo- , 
men, as for the just grief of the 
lady, whom he to paaaionately |

the diatress which the first com-

The answer which James Har< 
lowe returned to Colonel Morden's 
letter of notification of his aiater's 
death, and to her reijueat as to 
her interment, will give a faint 
idea of what their concern mwit 
be. — Here follows a copy of it. 



I cANHOT find words to express 
what we all suffer on the moat 
mournful news that ever was com- 
municated to us. 

My sister Arabella (but, alas! 
1 have now no other alslcr) was 
preparing tu follow Mrs. Norton 
up; and 1 had resolved to escort 
her, and to have looked in upon 
the dear creature. 

God be merciful to ns all ! To 
what purpose did the doctor write, 
if she was ao near her end? — 
Why, as every body says, did 
he not send sooner? — or wby, 
at aUV 



friend to be with her! — Alas!

thing but the hoaour of the fa- 
milTi 76t have I oU the weight 
thrown upon me — [O this cursed 
Lovelace! may I perish if he 
escape the deserved venceance!]'' 

We had begun to pfease oui 
Helves that we should soon see be 
here — good Ueaveu! that her 
neit entrance into this house, 
after she abandoned us so pre- 
cipitately, should be in a coffin. 

We can have nothing to do with 
her executor: (another strange 
step of the dear creature's!) he 
cannot eipect we will — nor , if he 
be a gentleman, will be think of 
acting. Do you therefore be 
pleased, sir, to order the under- 
taker to convey the body^ down to 
OS. My mother says, she shall 
be for ever unhappy, if she may 
not in death see the dear creature 
whom she could not see in life: be 
so kind therefore as to direct the 
lid to be only half-screwed down 
— that (if my poor mother cannot 
beprevailed upon to dispense with 
so shocking a spectacle) she may 
be obliged — she was the darling 
of her heart I 

If we know her will in relation 
to the funeral , it shall be punctu- 
ally complied with: as shall every 
thing in it that is fit or reasonable 
to be performed ; and this without 
the intervention of strangers. 

Will you not, dear sir, favour

Poor Mrs. Norton is eitremely

toMrs.ijinitbs maid (whom I have

in a mourning chariot) to take

We have got Lord M. to him,

at the lady's death. Hia sisters 
and nieces, he says, will be ready 
to break their hearts. What a

after all, she was no more.

is full as deep as for a wife) was 
brought home, and his fellows' 
mourning too. And, though eight 
o'clock, he would put it 00, and 
make them attend him in theire. 

Every body blames him on the 
lady's account. But I see not for 
why. She was a vixen in her vir-

OK, UibridgB.Ssi. Sept. 

I THINK it absolutely right that 

y ever dear and beloved ladv 

■houldbe opened and embalmea. 

It mast be done out of hand — 

this very afternoon. Your ac- 

Joaintance Tomkins, and old An- 
eraon of this place, whom I will 
bring with me, shall be the sur- 
geons, I have talked to the latter 
about it. 

I will see every thing done with 
that decorum which the case, and 
the sacred person of my beloved, 

£very thing that can be done to 
preserve the charmer from decay, 
shall also be done. And when she 
tuill descend to her original dust,' 
or cannot he kept longer, I wilt 
then have her laid in my family[ 



vault, between my own father and 
mother. Myself, as I am in my 
sW, so in ptr.suii, chief mourner. 
But her heart, to which 1 have 
such unquestioaablc pretensions, 
in which 1 had once so iarge a 
share, and which I will prize a- 
bove my own, I leill have. I will 
keepitmspiritfl. It shall never be 
out of my sight. And all the 
charges of sepiilline too shall be 

Surely nobody will dispute my 
right to her. Whose was she 
living? whose is she dead, bat 
mine? — Her cursed parents, 
whose barbarity to her, no doubt, 
was the tnie cause of her death, 
have long since renounced her. 
She left Ih/m for me. She chose 
me, therefore ; and I was her hus- 
band. What though I treated 
her like a villain? Do I not pay 
for it now? Would she not have 
been mine had I not? Nobody will 
dispute but she would. And has 
she not forgiven me? — I am then 
in sfalu quo pmis with her — am I 
not? — as if I had never offended? 
Whose then can she be but mine ? 

I will free you from your ejecu- 
torship, and all your cares. 

Take notice, tieiford, that I do 
hereby actually discharge you 
and every body, from all cares 
and troubles relating to her. And 
us to her last testament, I will 
eiecute it myself. 

There were no articles between 
us, no settlements; and she is 
mine, as you see I have proved to 
a demonstration; nor could she 
dispose of hcHKiK b'o.'i. aa\-^^M^^

I will have possession of her

I will take her papers. And, as 
no one can do her memory justice

And the worid shall also see, what

I HATK Toare, with our unbappj 
friend's inclosed. I am glad mj 
lord is with him. As I presome 
tbat his phrensj will be but of 
■hort coDtiDuance, I most earnest- 
ly wish, that on his recovery he 
could be prevailed upoQ to go 
abroad. Mr. Morden, who is in- , 
consolable, boa seen by the will 
(as indeed he suspected before he 
read it) that the case was more 
than a common seduction; and 
has dropt hints already, that be 
looks upon himself, on that ac- 
count, as freed from his prom iseB 
made to the dying lady, which 
were, that he would not seek to 
avenge her death. ' 

You must make the recovery of 
his health the motive for urging 
himon this head; for, if you hint 
at his own safety, be will not stir, 
but rather seek the colonel. 

As to the lock of hair, you may 
easily pacify him (as you once 
saw the angel) with hair near the 
colour, if he be latent upon it. 

At my lord's desire I will write, 
on, and in my common band ; that: 
you may judge what is, and what 
IS not, fit tone read to Mr. Love- 
lace at present. But as I shall not 
■ forbear reflections as 1 go along, 
iu hopes to reach his heart on his 
recovery, I think it best to direct 
myself to him still; andthatasif 
be were not disordered. 

As I shall not have leisure to 
take copies, and yet am willing to 
' sthe wJioIe subject beforemc, 



for my own future cont«mplatiou; 
1 must inrist upon a return of mj' 
letters sometime hence. Mr.Love* 
lace knows that this is one of my 
conditions; and has hitherto com- 
plied with it. 

Thy letter, Mowbray, is

task, which I had for some time 
past resolced to begja; that is to 
say, Ui go to church i and see if 1 
could not reap Bome henefit from 
what I should hear there. Ac- 
cordioKlj I determined to go to 
hear the celebrated preacher at 
St James's Church. But, as if the 
devil (for so I mas then ready to 
conclude) thought himself uon- 
ceroed to prevent my iuteution, a 
visit was made me, just as I was 
dreesed, which took me off from 



but from Sally Martia, accom- 
panied by Mrs. Carter, the sister 
of theinfamousSinelairl the sane, 
1 suppose I need not telt you, who 
keeps the Bagnio near Blooma- 

They t«ld me that the surgeou, 
apothecary, and physician, had all 

given the wretched womau o^ 

but that she said, she could 
die, nor be at rest, till she saw 
and they besought roe to acc' 
pauy them in the coach they ci 
in, if I had one spark of charity, of 
Chrislian charity, as they called 
it, left. 

I was very loth to he diverted 
from my purpose by a request bo 
unwelcome, and from people ao 
abhorred; but at last went, and 
we got thither by ten, when; a 
scene so shocking presented itself 
tome, thattheaei" ' "" "' 
spending Beiton is 
be compared with it. 

The old wretch had once put 
her leg out by her rage and 
violence, and had been crying, 
scolding, cursing, ever since the 



preceding evening, that the snr- 
geon had told her it was impos- 
sible to save her; andthatamor- 
tiScation had begun to shew it- 

"■ ' lomuch tnat, purely in 
compassion to their own e/in, they 
had been forced to send for an- 
other surgeon, purposely to tell 
her, thougli against his judgment, 

id (being a friend of the other)to 

em to convince hitit, that he mis- 
look her ease; and that if she 
would be patient, she might re- 
cover. But, nevertheless, her ap- 
prehensions of death, and her 
antipathy to the thoughts of dy- 
ing, were so strong, that their im- 
posture had not the intended 
effect, and she was raving, crying, 
cursing, and even howling, more 
like a wolf than a human creature, 
wheu I came ; so that as I went up 
stairs, 1 said. Surely this noise, 
this howling, cannot be from the 
unhappy woman! Sally said it 
was: and assured me. that it was 
nothing to the noise she had made 
all night; and stepping into her 
room before me, Dear Mi if awi Sin- 
clair, said she, forbear this noise! 
It is more like that of a bull than 
a woman! — Here comes Mr. Bel- 
ford; and you'll fright him away 
if you bellow at this rate. 

There were no less than eight 
of her cursed daughters surronnd- 
iug her bed when I entered; one 
ofher partners, Polly Horton, at 
their head; aud now Sally, her 
other partner, and Madam Carter, 
aa they called her (for they are all 
irad'iama with one another), made 
the number ten; all in shocking 
dishabille, and without sta.'j«.,'i^i--

'^ler miEfoTtime has not at all 
ik , but rather, as 1 thought, in- 
reased her flesh; rage and vio- 
Bice perhaps swellitig her mua- 
.nlar features. Behold her then, 
tpreadiug the whole tumbled bed 
^th her huge quaffgy carcase: 
t mill-poHt arms held up; her 
road hands clenched with via- 
; her big eyea, goggling and 
. ng red as we may suppose 
thoseof a salamander: her matted 



dress being half otF, spread about 
her fat ears and brawny neck); 
her livid ijps parched, and work- 
ing riolently; her broad chin 
in conTulsive motion ; her wide 
mouth , by reason of the contrac- 
tion of her forehead (which aeemed 
to be half lost in its own frightful 
furrows) splitting her face, as it 
were into two parts ; and her huge 
toogne hideously rolling in it; 
heaving, puffing asif for breath; 
her bellows- shaped and various 
coloured breasts ascending by 
turns to her chin, and descending 
out of sight with the violence of 
her saBpings, 

This was the spectacle, as re- 
collection has enabled me to de- 
scribe it , that this wretch made to 
iny eye, when I 



by her suffragans and daughters, 
«no surveyed her wiih scouling 
frighted attention , which one 
might easily see had more in it of 
horror and self-eoneem (and setf- 
condemnoiion too) than of lore or 
pity; as who should say, See! 
what wo ourselves must one 
day be ! 

As soon as she saw me, herna- 
tnraliy big voice , more hoarsened I 

by her ravings, broke upon me; 
O, Mr. Belfordl 0, sirl see what 
1 am come to! — See what I am J 
brought to! — To have such a 
cursed crew about me, and not 
one of them to take care of me! 
But to let me tumble down stairs 
so distant from the room I went 
from I so distant from the room I 
meant to go to! Cursed, cursed 
be every Cftreleas devil! — May 
this or worse be their fate , every 
one of them! 

And then she cursed and swore 
moat vehemently, and the more, 
as two or three of them were ex- 
cusing tbemselves on the score of 1 
their being at that time as unable 
to help themselves as she. As 
soon as she had cleared the pas- , 
sage of her throat by the oaths 
and curses which her wild im- 
patience had made her utter, she 
began in a more hollow and 
whniing strain to bemoan herself. 
And here, said she — Heaven 
grant me patience! [clenching 
and unclenching her hands] ami 
to die thus miserably! — of a 
broken leg in my old age! — 
snatched away by means of my 
ownintemperancal Self-do! Self- 
undone !— No time for my SI

THE HISTORY OP 



signs of ignorant wonder in their 
faces, as there appeared of ««//*- 
sufficiency in those of the artists,) 
(lia they by turns £11 my ears with 
an anatomical description of the 
leg and thigh; running over with 
terms of art, of the tarsus, the 
metatarsus, the tibia, the fibula, the 
patella, the os tali, the os tibicB, the 
tibialis posticus and tibialis anticus, 
up to the OS femoris, to the ace- 
tabulum of the OS ischion , the great 
trochanter , glutcms , triceps, lividus, 
and Utile rotators ; in short, of all 
the muscles, cartilages, and bones, 
that constitute the leg and thigh, 
from the great toe to the hip; 
as if they would shew me, that 
all their science had penetrated 
their heads no further than their 
mouths ; while Sally lifted up her 
hands with a — Laud bless me! 
are all surgeons so learned! — 
But at last both the gentlemen 
declared, that if she and her 
friends would consent to amputa- 
tion , they would whip off her leg in 
a moment. 

Mrs. Carter asked, to what pur- 
pose , if the operation would not 
save her? 

Very true, they said, but it 
might be a satisfaction to the pa- 
tient's friends , that all was done 
that could be done. 

And so the poor wretch was to 
be lanced and quartered, as I may 
say, for an experiment only! And, 
without any hope of benefit from 
the operation, was to pay the sur- 
geons for tormenting her! 

I cannot but say 1 have a mean 
opinion of both these gentlemen, 
vbo, though they make a flguve, it 



seems, in their way of living, and 

boast not only French extraction, 

; but a Paris education, never will 

! mUke any in their practice. 

I How unlike my honest English 

\ friend Tomkins , a plain , senons, 

intelligent man, whose art lies 

deeper than in words ; who always 

avoids parade and jargon ; and 

endeavours to make every one as 

I much a judge of what he is about 

as himself! 

All the time that the surgeons 
ran on with their anatomical pro- 
cess, the wretched woman most 
frightfully roared and bellowed; 
which the gentlemen (who shewed 
themselves to be of the class 
of those who are not affected 
with the evils they do not 
feel) took no other notice of, than 
by raising tfieir voices to be heard^ 
as she raised hers — being evident- 
ly more solicitous to increase their 
acquaintance, and to propagate 
the notion of their skill, than to 
attend to the clamours of the poor 
wretch whom they were called in 
to relieve; though by this very 
means, like the dog and the 
shadow in the fable, they lost both 
aims with me : for I never was de- 
ceived in one rule , which I made 
early ; to wit, that the stillest water 
is the deepest , while the bubbling 
stream only betrays shallowness; 
and that stones and pebbles lie 
there so near the surface, to point 
out the best place to ford a river 
dry shod.

happy wretch what every one ap- 
prehended must follow, and what

BiiBibie of the benefit of fresh air, 
the moment 1 entered the 
F*treet. 

' Nor is it to he wondered at, 
when it ia considered, that to the 
ill amelis that will he al-

physician comes, the air is shut

for one or other of the crea

gripes, or qualms, were conti-

all the time 1 waa there. And yet 
this is thought to be a genteel 
bonseof the sort: and all the pro- 
stitutes in it are prostitutes o< 
price', and their visitors people of 
note. 

0, Lovelace! what lives do 
most of us rakes and libertines 
lead! What company do^vekeepl 
And, for such company what so- 
ciety renounce, or endeavour to 
make like these! 

What woman, nice in ^ . 
son, andof purity in her mind and 
manners, did she know what miry 
wallowers the generality of menof 
oar class are m themselves , and 
constantly trough and sty with, 



hut would detest the thoughts of 
associating with such fillhy sen- 
aualiafs, whose favourite taste oar- 
them to mingle with the dregs 
of stews, brothels, and common 
sewers? 

Yet to such a choice are many 
worthy women betrayed, by that 
false inconsiderate notion, raised 
and propagated , no doubt , by the 
author of all delusion, Ihal a re- 
formed rake makes Ihe hesl husband. 
We rakes , indeed , are bold 
enough to suppose, that women in 
general are as much rakes in their 
hearts, as the libertines, some of 
them, suffer themselves to he 
taken with, are in their practice. 
A supposition , therefore , which it 
behoves persons of true honour of 
that sex to discountenance, by re- 
jecting the address of every man, 
whose character will not stand the 
test of that virtue which is the 
glory of awoman: and, indeed, I 
may say, of a man too: why 
should it not? 

How, indeed, can it be, if this 
point beduly weighed, thata man, 
who thinks alike of all the sex, and 
knows it to be in the power of a 
wife to do him the greatest dis- 
honour man can receive, and 
doubts not her will to do it, if dd- 
poriumty offer , and importumtyl/e 
not wanting: that £tic7i a one, from 
principle, should be a good hus- 
band to mty woman? And, in- 
deed, little do innocents think, 
what a total revolution of manners, 
vhat a cluini/e of fixed haliiti , nay, 
what a conquest of a bad nature,

of my own experience) thou,Love- 
Uee, bast found in the progress of 
thy attempts upon the divine Mies 
Harlone. For whose remorses 
could be deeper, or more frequent, 
yet more transient than thine! 

Now, Lovelace, let me know if 
the word giace can be read from 
my pen, without a aneer from thee 
aud thy associates? 1 own that 
once it sounded oddly in mi/ ears. 
But I shall never forget what a 
grave man once said on this very 
word — that with him it was a

hopes of one who could bear tie 
mention of it without ridiculing 
it; and ever gave him up for an 
abandonedman, whomadeajest

hand from that of her eiater Her- 
vey, and pressing mine with it, 
you know not what a child I have 
lost! — Then, in a lower voice, 
and kow lost! — That it is that 
makes the loss insupportable. 

They all joined m a kind of 
melancholy chorus, and each ac- 
cused him and heritelf, and some 
of them one another. But the eyes 
ofall, in turn, were cast upon my 
cousin James, as the person who 
had kept up the general resent- 
ment against so sweet a creature- 
While he waa hardly able 1o bear 
his own remorse: nor Miss Har- 
lowe hersi she breaking out into 
words. How tauntingly did I write 
to her! How barbarously did I in- 
sult herl Yet how patiently did 
■be take it! — Who would have 



but for yii}i! — but for gou! 
Double uot upon me, said he, my 
own woes! I have every thing be- 
fore me tfaatbas passed! I thought 
only to reclaim a dear crea' — 
that bad erred! I intended n< 
break her tender heart! But it 
was the villainous Lovelace who 
did that — not any of iis! Yet, 
cousin, did she not attribute all 
tome?— I fear she did! — Tell 
me only, did she name me, did she 
gpealc of me, in her last hours? I 
—.iope she, who could forgive the 



345 

greatest villain on earth, and 
plead that he may be safe from 
our vengeance, I hupe she could 
forgive ijie. 

She died blessing you all; and 
justified rather than condemned 
your severily to her. 

Then they set up another gene- 
ral lamentation. We see, said her 
fRther,cnough we sec in her heart- 
piercing letters touB, what a happy 
frame she was in a few days be- 
fore her death — but did it hold to 
the last? Had she no repinings? 
Had the dear child no heart- 
burnings? 

None at all ! — I never saw, and 
never shall see, so blessed a de- 
parture: aud no wonder; for I 
never beard of such a. preparation. 
Every hour, for weeks together, 
was taken up in it. Let this be 
our comfort; we need only to wish 
for BO happy an end for ourselves, 
and for those who are nearest to 
our hearts, Wemay any of usbe 
grieved for acts of unkindness to 
her: hut had all happened that 
once she wished for, soe conid not 
have made a happier, perhaps not 
ao happy an end. 

Dear soul! and dear sweetEoull 
the father, uncles, sister, my cousia 
Hervey, cried out all at once, in 
accents of anguish ineipressibly 
affecting. 

We must for ever be disturbed 
for those acts of unkindneas to ao 
sweet a child, cried the unhappy 
mother, — Indeed ! indeed! [aottly 
to her sister Hervey] I have been 
too passive, much too passive, in 
this case ! — The temporary quiet 
I have been bo studious all mj li£%

THE HISTORY OF 



to preserve, has cost me everlast- 
ingdisquiet! — There she stopt. 

Bear sister! — was all Mrs. 
Hervey could say. 

I have done but half my duty to 
the dearest and most meritorious 
of children, resumed the sorrowing 
mother! — Nay, not half! — flow 
have we hardened our hearts 
against her! — Again her tears 
denied passage to her words. 

My dearest, dearest sister ! again 
was all Mrs. Uervey could say. 

Would to Heaven , proceeded, 
exclaiming, the poor mother, I had 
but once seen her! Then, turning 
to my cousin James, and his sister 

— my son! my Arabella! If 
WE were to receive as little mercy 

— and there again she stopt, her 
tears interrupting her further 
speech J every one, all the time, 
remaimng silent; their counten- 
ances shewing a grief in their 
hearts too big for expression. 

Now you see, Mr.JBelford, that 
my dearest cousin could be allowed 
all her merit! — What a dreadful 
thing is after-reflection upon a con- 
duct so perverse and unnatural, 

this cursed friend of yours, 
Mr. Belfprd ! This detested Love- 
lace! — To him, to him is owing — 
pardon me , sir. I will lay down 
my pen till I have recovered my 
temper. 

One in the morning. 

In vain, sir, have I endeavoured 
to compose myself to rest. You 
wished me to be very particular, 
and I cannot help it. This melan- 
choly subject fills my whole mind. 
I will proceed , though it be mid- 
"light 



About six o'clock the hearse 
came to the outward gate — the 
parish-church is at some distance; 
but the wind setting fair, tiie 
afflicted family were struck. Just 
before it came, into a fresh ntof 
grief, on hearing the funeral bell 
tolled in a very solemn manner. 
A respect, as it proved, and as they 
all guessed, paid to the memory of 
the dear deceased, out of officious 
love, as the hearse passed near the 
church. 

Jud^e , when their ^ief was so 
great m expectation of it , what it 
must be when it arrived. 

A servant came in to acquaint 
us with what its lumbering heavy 
noise up the paved inner court- 
yard apprised us of before. He 
spoke not. He could not speak. 
He looked, bowed and withdrew. 

I stept out. No one else could 
then stir. Her brother, however, 
soon followed me. When I came 
to the door, I beheld a sight very 
affecting. 

You have heard, sir, how uni- 
versally my dear cousin was be- 
loved. By the poor and middling 
sort especially, no young lady was 
ever so much beloved. And with 
reason: she was the common 
patroness of all the honest poor in 
her neighbourhood. 

It is natural for us, in every deep 
and sincere grief, to interest all 
we know in what is so concerning 
to ourselves. The servants of the 
family, it seems, had told their 
friends, and those theirs, that 
though, living, their dear young 
lady could not be received nor 
looKed upon, her body was per- 



Mitted to be brought home. The 

S ace of time was ao confined, that 
jBe who knew when she died, 
toiiat easily guess near the time the 
i&earBG was to come. A hearse, 

i through country villages, 
om London, however 
rfenderly attended, {for the cha- 
'fiot, BBlhave said, waited upon 
■ Mrs. Norton) takes every 
tine's attention. Nor was it hard 
to guess whose /^w must be, though 
not adorned by escutcheons, when 
ross roads to Harlowe Place 
■tiere taken, as soon as it came 
within six miles of it: so that the 
Learse, and the solemn tolling of 
flie bell, had drawn together at 
least fiftyoftheneighbouringmen, 
^meu, and children, and some of 
d appearance. Not a soul of 
Soem, it seems, with a dry eye, and 
sach lamenting the death of this 
Wmired lady, «*j, oslamtold, 
lecer >tirre<l out hit someboihj was 
ie better for her. 
^ These, whenthecoffinwastaken 
ont of the hearse, crowding about 
t, hindered for a few moments its 
Ming carriedin; theyouugpeople 
'Btruggling who should hear it ; and 
jret, with respectful tc/iisperrajs, 
Hftther than clamorous rvnlen 
L mark of veneration I had n 
lefore seen paid , upon any c 
ion, in all my travels, from the 
IBderbred many,from whom noise 
!l generally inaepiuableinall their 
mutations. 

At last six maidens were ] 
jutted to carry it in by the 
vandles. 

Thecorpse was thus borne, with 
" e most solemn leapect. into the 



347 

hall, and placed for the present . 
upon two stools there, TheplateB, 
and emblems, and inscription, set 
every one gazing upon it, and 
admiring it. The more, when they 
were told that all was of her own 
ordering. They wished to be per- 
mitted a sight of the corpse; but 
rather mentioned this as tneirwii/i 
than as their hope. When they 
had all satisfied their curiosity, 
and remarked upon the emblems, 
they dispersedwithbleBsingsupon 
her memory, and with tears and 
lamentations; pronouncing her to 
be happy; and inferring, were 
tr^enotso, what would become of 
them? While others ran overwith 
repetitions of the good she de- 
lighted to do, Nor were there 
wanting those among them, who 
heaped curses upon the man who 
was the author of her fall. 

The servants of the family then 
got about the coffin. They could 
not before: and that afforded a 
of sorrow: but a silent 



one; for they spoke only by their 
eves, and by sighs, looking upon 
the lid, and upon one another, by 
turns, with hands lifted up. The 
presence of their young master 
possibly might awe them, and 
cause their grief to be expressed 
only in dumb show. 

As for Mr. JftmesHarlowo, (who 
accompanied me, but withdrew 
when he saw the crowd] he stood 
looking upon the lid, when tho 
people had left it, with a fixed 
attention; yet, X daresay, knew 
not a symbol or letter upon it at 
that moment, had the question 
been asked him. In. u.^x:cAmxSL.

leverie be stood, bUarmE folded, 
his head on one aide, and marks of 
stupefaction imprinted up on every 
feature. 

But when the corpsewaacarried 
into the lesser parlour adjoining to 
itie hall, which she used to caJl her 
parlour, and put upon a table in 
ti)e middle of the room, and the 
father and mother,the two uncles, 
her aunt Hervej, and her sister, 
came in, joining her brother aud 
me,with trembling feet, and eager 
Toe, the scene was still more 
iffectiDg. Their aorrow was 
heightened, no doubt, bf the re- 
membrance of their unforgiving 
■everlty: and now seeing before 
them the receptacle that contained 
the gVoTj ot their family, who so 
late^ was driven thence by their 
indiscreet violence; never, never 
■nore to be reatoted to theml no 
wonder that their grief was more 
■"" an common grief. 

They would have withheld the 
jnother, it seems, from coming in; 
but when they could not, though 
■undetermined before, they all bore 
her company, led on by an impulse 
liiey could not resiat. The poor 
lady but just cast her <~ 
the coffin, and then sn 
ftway, retiring with passionate 
grief towards the window; yet 
addressing herself, with clasped 
ban da, aa if to her beloved 
daughter; my child, my child 1 
cried she; thou pride of my hope 1 
Why wasi not permitted to speak 
pardon and peace to thee! — 
forgive thy cruel mother! 

Her Bon (his heart then softened, 
as his eyes shewed) besought her 



to withdraw; and her woman 
looking in at that moment, be 
called her to assist him in coa- 
ducting her lady into the middle 
parlour: and then returning, met 
his father going out at the door, 
who also had but just cast his ej4 
on the cofHn, and yielded to my 
entreaties to withdraw. His grief 
was too deep for utterance, till be 
saw his son coming In; and then, 
fetching a heavy groan, Never, 
said he, was sorrow like my sorrow! 
— Oson! aonl — in a reproacliiDg 
accent, his face turned from tijm. 

I attended him through the 
middle parlour, endeavoiiring to 
console him. His lady wae theR 
Jes. She took his eye. B» 

motion towards her; Omy 

dear, said he — but turning- ehort, 
bis eyes as full as his heart, he 
hastened through to thegreat par- 
lour: and when there, he desired 
me to leave him to himself. 

The uncles andthe sister, looked 
sndtumed away, very often, upon 
the emblems, in silent aorrow. 
Mrs. Hervey would liave read to 
them the inscription — these wonia 
she did read , here the leicked cetue 
from troubling ^but could read no 
farther. Her teara fell in large 
drops upon the plate she was con- 
templating; and yet she was de- 
sirous of gratifying a curiosity that 
mingled impatience with her grief 
because she could nor gratify it, 
although she often wiped her eyes 
as they flowed. 

Judge you, Mr. Belf ord (for you 
have great humanity) how i must 
be a^cted. Yet was I forced to 
try to comfort them all. 



But here I will cloEe this letter, 
in order to send it to yon in the 
Tnoming early. Nevertheless, I 
will begin another, upon suppoei- 
tion that mj doleful prolixity will 
uot be disagreeable to you. lu- 
deed I am altogether indisposed 
for rest, as I mentioned before. So 
can do nothing but write. I have 
also more melancholy scenes to 
paint. Mypen, if I may bo say, is 
untired. These scenes are &esh 
upon my memory: and I myself, 
perhaps, may owe to you the 
favour of a review of them , with 
such other papers as you shall 
think proper t^ oblige me with, 
toften heacy grief has gieen wai/ lu 
milder melancholy. 

My servant, m his way to you 
with this letter, shalL call at St. 
Alban'a upon the good woman, 
that he may inform you how she 
does. Miss Arabella asked m« 
after her, when I withdrew to my 
chamber; to which she complai- 
santly accompanied me. She was 
much coacerued at the bad way 
we left her in \ and said her mother ' 
would be more so. i 

No wonder that the dear de- 1 
parted, who foresaw the remorse 
thatwould failto the lot of this un- 
happy family when they came to 
have the news of her death cod- 
frmed to them, was so grieved for 
their apprehended grief, and en- 
^eavovred to comfort ihem by lier 
posthumous letters. But it was still 
a greater generosity in her to trr 
to excuse tiiem t« me, as she dia, 
when we were alone together, a 
few hours before she died; and to, 
aggravate more than fas far as I 



349 

can find) she ought to have done, 
the only error she was ever guilty 
of. The more freely however 

ferhapa (exalted creature !) that 
mieht think the better of her 
li-ienas, although at her own ex- 
pense. 1 am, dear sir , 

Your faithful and obedient 
servant, 

Wm. Moedes. 



Wqbm the unhappy mourners 
wore all retired, I directed the lid 
of the coffin to he unscrewed, and 
caused some fresh aromatics and 
flowers to be put into it. 

The corpse was very little al- 
tered, notwithstanding the jour- 
ney. The sweet smile remained. 

The maids who brought the 
flowers were ambitious of strew- 
ing them aboutit: they poured 
forth fresh lamentations over her; 
each wishing she had been so 
happy as to hare been allowed to 
attend her in London. One of 
them particularly, who is, it 
seems, my cousin Arabella's per- 
sonal servant, was more clamorous 
in her grief than any of the rest ; 
and the moment she turned her 
back, all the others allowed she 
had reason for it. I inquired af- 
terwards about her , and found 
that this creature was set over my 
dear cousin, when she was con- 
fined to her chamber by indiscreet 
severity. 

Good Heaven ! that they should, 
treat, and Buffiii'c't\i'aa\a\i'i\.'W.^~^ 



350 THE uis 

a young lady, who was qualified 
to give TawB to all her family 1 

When my cousiu* were told, 
that the lid was unscrewed, they 
preased in again, all but the 
mouToful father and mother, as if 
by consent. Mrs. Hervey kissed 
her pale lips. Flower of the world! 
was all she could say; and gave 
place to Mias Arabella; who kiss- 
ing the forehead of lia- whom she 
had so cruelly treated could only 
say, to my cousin James (looking 
upon the corpse, and upon him) 
O, brother! — While he^ taking 
the fair lifeless hand, kissed it, 
and retreated with precipitation. 

Her two uncles were speechleos. 
They seemed to wait each other's 
example, whether to look upon 
the corpse or not I ordered the 
lid to be replaced ; and they then 
preased forward, as the othei 



;ain did, to take a last farewell fithi 



of the casket which so lately 
tainedsorich ajewel. 

Then it was that the grief of 
each found fluent expression ; and 
the fair corpse was addressed to, 
with all the tenderness that the 
•incerest love and warmest ad- 
liration could inspire, each ac- 
rding to their different degrees 



betokened lier being so! Tlietn- 
nehes tnoat unhappy !— And then, 
once more, the brother took the 
lifeless band, and vowed revengd 
upon it, on the cursed author of 
all this distress. 

The unhappy parents proposed 
to take one last view and farewell 
of their once darling daughter. 
The father was ^ot to the parlour 
door, after the inconsolable mo- 
ther: but neither of them were 
able to enter it. Tbemother said, 
she must once more see the child 
of her heart, or she should never 
enjoy herself. But they both 
agreed to refer their metanebobr 
curioeity till the next day; ud 
hand in handretired inconsolable, 
and speechless both, their facea 
overspread with woe, and turned

He called out liia Bister, and she 
was of his opiition. So 1 left this 
upon them. 

They both, with no little 
warmth, hinted their disapproba-

cousin was obliged to your friend-

tiuns she laid you under, and your 
own inclination to observe tnem. 
J said, that you were a man of

, not willingly give oflcnce to any 
of them ; and that I was very fond 
of cultivating your favour and

declared, that he would write to

They were surjirised, that I bad 
given up to you the produce of

deatu. I told them plainly, that 
they must thank thcmselveB if 
any thing disagreeable to them

They replied, they would re-

aud mother; addiug, that great 
as their trouble was, they uund 
they had more still to come. But 
if Mr. Belford were to be the execn- 
tor of her will, contrary to their 
hopes, thoy besought me to take 
the trouble of transacting every 
thing with you; that a friend of 
the man to whom they owed all 
their calamity might not appear 
to them. 

They were extremely moved at 
the text their sister had chosen for 
the subject of the funeral dia- 
course.** I had extracted from 
the will that article, supposing it

probable, that I might not so aooii 
have an opportunity to shew them 
the will itself, as would otherwiae 
have been necesBary, on account 
of the interment; which cannot be 
delayed. 

Toe unhappy family are pre- 
paring for a mournful meeting at 
breakfast. Mr. Jamea Harlowe, 
who has had as little rest as I, haa 
written to Mr, MelviDe, who has 
promised to draw up a brief eulo- 
giun on the deceased. MisaHowc 
IB expected here by-and-by, to 
see, for the last time, her beloved 
friend. 

MiBH Howe, by her messenger, 
desires she msy not be taken any 
notice of. Shs shall not tarry six 
minutea, was the word. Her desire 
will be easily granted her. 

Her servant, who brought the 
request, if it were denied, was to 
return, and meet her; for she was 
ready to set out in her chariot, 
when he got on horseback.

about half an hour after 
Slowly did the mournful cor ^ 
meet. Each lifelessly and spiriOl 
leaa took our places, with swolgl 
eyea, inquiring, without eipectbOT 
any tolerable account, how e 
had rested. 

The sorrowing mother gav 
answer, that she should i

By the tiuiewewerewi 
tlie bell ringing, the outward g**^— 
opening, a chariot rattling OTsra 
(be pavement of the court yardf ' 
put tliem into emotion. 

I left them: and was just time 
enough to give MIbb Howe my 
hand as she alighted : her maid in I 
tears remaining in the chariot. 

I think you told me, sir, yoV 
never saw Miss Howe. She u * 
fine graceful young lady. A fixed 
melancholy on her whole aspecti 
overclouded a vivacity and fire, 
which, nevertheless, darted now- 
and - then through the awtU 
^loom. I shall ever respect hn 
tor her love to my dear couun. 

Never did 1 tlunk, said ebe, ■ 
she gave me her hand, to ent' 
more these doors: but, living OK 
dead, my Clarissa brings me tuter 
her any -whither. 

She entered with me the littltt 
parlour; and seeing the ooffin^ 
withdrew her hand from mine| 
and with impatience pushed asidfl 
the lid. As impatiently she t» 
moved the face-olotb. In a wild 
air, she clasped her uplifted hand! 
together; and now looked npoq 
i~'tbe corpse, now up to heaven, att 
if appealing to that. Her bosen

Then, after a short pause, and 
a profound Bigh,she turned to me, 
and then to her breathless friend. 
But M she, can she be really dead ! 

— no! — She only sleeps. —

owing to the very posthumous let- 
ters, as I may call them, which 
you, Mr, Belford, as well as I, ap- 
prehended would have had fatal 
effects apon her. 

I cannot but attribute this to 
the right turn of her mind. It

till the funeral rites are performed. 
Preparations are makmg for the 
solemnity; and the servants, as 
well as principals of all the 
branches of the family , are pnt 
into close mourning. 

I have seen Mr. Melville, He is 
a serious and sensible man. I 
have given him particulars to go 
upon in the discourse he is to pro- 
nounce at the funeral; but had the 
less need to do this, as I find he is 
eitremely well acquainted with 
' e whole unhappy stor^; and was 

personal admirer of my dear 

usin, and a sincere lamenter of 
her miafortunea and death. The 
reverend Dr. Lewen, who is but 
very lately dead, was his parti- 
cular friend, and had once intend- 
ed to reconunend himtoherfavouT 
and notice. 

1 AM just returned from attend- 
g the afflicted parents, in an

of their beloved child. They had

clasped round her waist. The two 
mothers, as I may call them, of 
my beloved cousin, thus tenderly 
engagied! What a variety of dis- 
tress lu these woeful scenes ! 

The Unhappy father, in en- 
deavouring to comfort his lady,

carried tno high, to acquiesce as 1

THE msTORV OP 



I 



have joiiied in these last honoura 
had they been able ; but the; weie ' 
both ver; much indispoBed ; and j' 
continue to be ao. I 

The inconsolable mother totd' 
Mra.NortOD, thatthe two mothers! 
of the sweetest child in the world ■ 
ought not, on this occftsion, to 
be separated. She therefore de- 1 
sired her to slay with her. ! 

The whole solemnity w&s per-j 
formed with great decency and I 
order. The distance from Har- 
lowe Place to the church is about 
hftlfamile. Ali thewaythe corpse 
was attended by great numbers of 
people of all conditions. 

It was nine when it entered the 
church; every corner of which 
was crowded. Such a profound, 
such a silent respect did I never 
see paid at the funeral of princes. 
An attentive sadness overspread 
the face of all. 

The eulogy pronounced by Mr. 
Melville was a very pathetic one. 
Hewiped his own eyes often, and 
made every body present still 
oftenerwipe theirs. 

The auditors were most parti- 
cularly affected, when he told 
them, that the solemn text was her 
own choice. 

He enumoraled her fine quali- 
ties, naming with honour their 
late worthy pastor for his autho- 

Every enumerated eiccellence 
was witnessed to in different parts 
of the church in respectful whis-j 
pers by different persons, as ofi 
their own knowledge, as I have 
been since informedT 

When he pointed to the pew| 



where {doing credit toreligio 
her example) she used to sit < 
kneel, the whole auditory, as or' 
person, turned to the pew wi 
the moat respectful aolemnity, I 
if she had been herself there. 

When the gentleman attribnti 
condeaccusion and mingled digi 
ty to her, a buzzing approbstu 
was given to the attribute throo^ 
out the church; and a poor nel 
woman under my pew addei 
" That she was indeed all ga 
id would speak i 



Umy eres ran over, when 1 
mentioned her charities, her wel 
judged charities. And her re 
was decreed from every n 
with sigha and sobs from e 
and thesewordsfromothers, ' 
poor will dearly miss her," 

The cheer fill gifcr whom God i 
said to love, was allowed to b 
her: and ayounglady, I am toM 
said, It was Miss Clarissa Ht 

lowe's care to find out the o 

happy, upon a sudden distress 
before the sighing heart waf 
whelmed by it. 

She had a set of poor peopt«| 
chosen for their remarkable how 
esty and ineffectual industrj;; 
These voluntarily paid tbeir laat 
attendance on their benefactren 
and mingling in the church U 
they could crowd near the usJi 
where the corpse was on b: 
it was the less wonder that htf 
praiaea from the preacher met 
with such general and such grata- 
ful whispers of approbation. 

Some it seems there were, wit9 
knowing her unhappy stofj', i~ 



CLARISSA BAfiLO^ 



marked upon the dejected looks 
of the brother, and the drowned 
eyes of the sister; "Owhatwould 
tney now give, they'd warrant, 
haa tbcy not been so hard-heart- 
ed!" — Others pursued , aalmay 
say, the severe father and unhappy 
mother, into their chambers at 
home — " Theyanswered for their 
relenting, now, that It was too 
late ! — What must be their grief! 
— No aonder they could not be 
present ! " 

Several eipresaedtheirastouish- 
ment, as people do every hour, 
"that a man could lire whom Guch 

Eerfectiona could not engage to 
e just to her;" to be Mnnane, I 
may say. — And who, her rank 
and fortuue considered, could be 
BO disregardful of his own iiileresl, 
had he had no other motive to be 
just? — 

The good divine, led by his 
teit, just touched upon the un- 
happy atep that was the cause of 
her untimely fate. He attributed 
it to the state of things below, in 
which there could not be absolute 
perfection. He veir politely 
touched upon the noble disdain 
she shewed (though earncBtly 
Bolicited hj a, whole splendid fa- 
mily) to jom interests with a man 
whom she found unworthy of her 
esteem and confidence: and who 
courted her with the utmost ear- 
nestness to accept of him. 

What he most insisted upon 
was, the happy end she made; 
&nd thence drew consolation to hor 
relations, and instruction to the 
auditory. 
In a word, his performance was 



359 

such as heightened the reputation 
which he bad before in a very 
eminent degree obtained, 

When the corpse was to be car- 
ried down into the vault (a very 
spacious one, within the church) 
there was great crowding to see 
the coffin lid, and the devices 
upon it. Particularly two gen- 
tiemen , muffled up in cloaks, 
pressed forward. These, it seems, 
were Mr. Mullins and Mr, Wyer- 
ley; both of them professed ad- 
mirers of my dear cousin. 

When they came neat the coffin, 
and cast their eyes upon the lid, 
"In that little space," aaid Mr. 
Mullins, "is included all human 
eicellencel" — And then Mr. 
Wyerley, unable to contain him- 
self, was forced to quit the church; 
and we hear is very ill. 

It is said that Mj*. Solmes was in 
a remote part of the church, 
wrapped round in a horseman's 
coat: and that he shed tears 
several timea. But I saw him 

Another gentleman was there 
incognito, m a pew near the en- 
trance of the vault, who bad not 
been taken notice of, but for his 
great emotion when he looked 
over hia jiew, at the time the coffin 
was earned down to its last place. 
This was Mies Howe's worthy Mr. 

My cousins John and Antony, 
and their nephew James, chose 
not to descend into the vault 
among their departed ancestors. 

Miss Harlowe was extremely 
afiected. Her conscience, as well 
asherlove, was concerned on the

I HOPE , from the character my 
worthy cousin Morden gives you, 
that you will excuse the applica- 
tion I make to you, to oblige a 
whole family in au atfair that 
much concerns their peace, and 
cannot equally concern any body 
else, You will immediately judge, 
that this is ■' - ■ ^" 



of which my sister has given you 
the trouble by her last will. 

We shall all think ourselves 
eitremely obliged to you, if you 
please to relinquish this trust to 
our own family; the reasons which 
follow pleading for our expecta- 
tion of this favour from you:

of her near relalioDs would have

Secondly, I understand, that 
she recommends to you in the 
will, to trnat to the honour of any 
of our family, for the performance 
of Bach of the articlea as are of a 
domestic nature. We are any of 
us, anda//of ua,if yourequest it, 
willing to stake our honours upon 
thia DCcaBion: and all you can de- 
aire, as a mau of honour, is, that 
the tmat be executed. 

We are the more concerned, 
air, to wish you to decline thia 
office, because of your short and 
accidental knowledge of the dear 
testatrix, and long and intimate 
acquaintance with tbe man to 
whom she owed her ruin, aud we 
tbe greatest loss and disappoint- 
ment (her manifold exceliencies 
considered) that ever befel

You will allow due weight, 
dare say, to this plea, if you make 
our case your own : and so much 
the readier, when I aasure you, 
that your interfering in this 
matter ao much against our in- 
clinations (excuse, sir, my plain

IwENi back in this part of i 
coDversation to the day that 1 1 
obliged to come down to attend 
my lord, ia the dangerous illnesB 
which gome feared would have beer 
bis last. 

I told the colonel, "whateamest 
letterslbad written toaparticular 
friend, to engage him to prevail 
upon the lady not to slip a day 
that had been proposed for the 
private celebration of our nuptiala ; 
and of my letters* written to her- 
self on that subject;" for I had 
stepped to my closet, and fetched 
down all the letters and draughts, 
and copies of letters, relating to 
this affaur. 

I read to him "several passages 
in the copies of those letters, which 

" ieUcrs Ivli. ivlli. Bs. Uiil. of VuL UI. 



thou wilt remember make not a 
bttle to my honour." And I told 
him, "that 1 wished I bad kept 
copiesof those tomy friend on the 
lion; by which he would 
how much in earnest I 
professions to her, al- 
thoueh sfie would not answer oi 
of them." And thou njay'st n 
member, that ono of those fboT 
letters accounted to herself, wb/ 
1 was desirous she should remain, 
where I had left her.* 

I then proceeded to give him ta,' 
account "of the visit made hf, 
Lady Sarah and Lady Betty to 
LordM.andme.in order to indncs 
me to do her justice: ofmytead)^ 
ness to comply with their deures; 
and of their high opinion otha^

(though so much to my diiad- 
vantoce) which was written tO hsf 
by Misa Charlotte MontaguBi 
Ang. 1,** entreating her allianoH 
in the names of all our family. 

This made him ready tothinlw 
that his fair cousin carried iMT 
resentment against me toobr. Hs 
did not imagiue, he said, that 
either myself or our family h 
been BO much in earnest.

ehaimtog creature, with all her 
innocence, hare made of it in a

I then hinted at the generou! 
annual tender which Lord M. and 
his Biaters made to Lia fair cousin, 
ia apprehension that she might 
Buffer Dy her friends' implacaffie- 

And this also the colonel hiehly 
applauded, and was pleased to 
lament the unhappy misunder- 
standing between the two families, 
which had made the Uarlowes leas 
fond of an alliance with a family 
of 80 much honour, as this iustance 
shewed ours to be. 

I then told him, "that having, 
by my friend, [meaning thee] who 
was admitted into her presence, 
(and who had always been an 
admirer of her virtues, and had 
pvennte such advice from time to 
Ume in relation to her as 1 wished 
I had followed) been assured, that 
a visit from me would be very dis- 
agreeable to her, I once more 
resolved to try what a letterwould 
do; and that, accordingly, on the 
7th of August 1 wrote to her one. 

"This, colonel, is the copy of it. 
I was then out of humour with my 
lOrdlfT. and the ladies of myfa- 
Tou will therefore read it

203 

This letter gave him high aatis- 
faction. You write here , Mr, 
Lovelace, from your heart. 'Tisa 
letter full of penitence and ac- 
knowledsment. Your request is 
reasonable — to be forgiven only 
as you shall appear to deserve it 
after a time of probation, which 
you leave to her to fix. Pray, sir, 
did she return an answer to this 
letter? 

She did, but with I'e/MCfaitce, I 
own, and not tilll had declared by 
my friend, that if 1 could not pro- 
cure one, I would go up to town, 
and throw myself at her feet. 

1 wish 1 might be permitted to 
see it, sir, or to hear such parts 
of it read, as you ahall think 
proper. 

Turoiug over my papers, Here 
it is, sir.* I will make no scruple 
to put it into your hands. 

This is very obliging, Mr.Love-

Good heaven! that such an ei-

use of them to the advantage of 
you both. 

I told him, I would oblige him 
with all my heart And this he 
took very kindly (as he had rea- 
son) ; and put them in his pocket- 
book, promising to return them in 
a few days. 

I then told him, " that upon this 
her refusal, I took upon myself to 
go to town, in hopes to move her 
m my favour; and that, though I 
went without giving her notice of 
my intention, yet had she got some 
notion of my coming , and so con- 
trived to be out of the way : and 
at last, when she found I was fully 
determined at all events to see her, 
before I went abroad, (which I 
shall do, said I, if I cannot prevail 
upon her) she sent me the letter I 
have already mentioned to you, 
desiring me to suspend my pur> 
posed visit: and that for a reason 
which amazes and confounds me \ 
because I don*t find there is any 
thing in it: and yet I never knew 
her once dispense with her word ; 
for she always made it a maxim, 
that it was not lawful to do «i7, that 
good might come of it: and yet in 
this letter, for no reason in the 
world but to avoid seeing me, (to 
gratify an humour only) has she 
sent me out of town, depending 
upon the assurance she had given 
me. 

Col, This is indeed surprising. 
But I cannot believe that my 
cousin, for such an end only, or in> 
deed for any end, according to the 
character 1 hear of her, should 
stoop to make use of such an 
artince. 



Lovel, This, colonel, is the tiung 
that astonishes me; and yet, see 
here! — This is the letter she 
wrote me — nay , sir , 'tis her own 
hand. 

Col. I see it is; and a charming 
hand it is. 

LoveL You observe, colonel, 
that all her hopes of reconciliation 
with her parents are from yon. 
You are her dear blessed friend! 
She always talked of you with 
delight. 

Col. Would to heaven I had 
come to England before she left 
Harlowe Place ! — Nothing of this 
had then happened. Not a man 
of those whom I have heard that 
her friends proposed for her, 
should have had her. Nor yon, 
Mr. Lovelace , unless I had found 
you to be the man, every one who 
sees you must wish you to be: and if 
you had been that man, no one 
living should I have preferred to 
you for such an excellence. 

Mj lord and I both joined in the 
wish: and 'faith I wished it most 
cordially. 

The colonel read the letter twice 
over , and then returned it to me. 
'Tis all a mystery, said he. I can 
make nothing of it. For, alas ! her 
friends are as averse to a recon- 
ciliation as ever. 

Lord M. I could not have 
thought it. But don't you think 
there is something very favour- 
able to my nephew in this letter 
— something tnat looks as if the 
lady would comply at last? 

Col. Let me die if I know what 
to make of it. This letter is very 
different from her preceding one. 



ri- You returned an answer to it, 
Mr. Lovelace? 
Lnvel. An answer, colonel! No 
doubt of it. And an answer full 
of transport. 1 told her, "I would 
directly set out for LordM.'s, in 
obedience to Uer will. I told her 
that I would consent to an; tiling 
she should command , in order to 

r'omote this hapjiy reconciliation, 
told her, thiLt it should be my 
hourly study to the end of my life, 
to deserve a goodness so transcen- 
dent" But I cannot forbear Bay- 
ing, that I am not a little shocked 
andenrpriied, if nothingmorebe 
meant by it , than to get me into 

^tIle country without seeing her. 
Col. That can't be the thing, 
'«|epeaduponit,sir: there must be 
iboie in it thsii that. For were 
Aat all, she must think you would 
soon be undeceived , and that you 
woald then most probably resume 
your intention ~ unless , indeed, 
she depended upon seeing tiie in 
the interim, as she knew 1 wtis 
arrived. But I own, I know not 
what to make of it. Only that

James comes from Edinburgh; 
and he is every hour espected. 

But let me ask you, Mr. Love- 
lace, what is the name of your 
friend , who is admitted so easily 
into my cousin's presence? Is it 
not Belford, pray? 

Lovel. It is, air; Mr.Belford is 
amau of honour; andagreatad- 
mirer of your fair cousin. 

Was 1 right, as to the ;?<■,!/, Jack ? 
The laul 1 have such strong proof 
of, that it makes me questjon the 
^rst; since she would not have 
been out of the way of my intend- 
ed visit but for thee. 

Cot. Are you sure, air, that Mr. 
Belford is a man of honour? 

Liipcl. I can swear for him, 
colonel. What makes you put 
this question? 

Col. Only this; that anofficiouf 
pragmatical novice has been sent 
up to inquire into my cousin's life 
and conversation; and, would you 
believeitjthei'reQueutvisiUof this 
:entleman have oeen interpreted 



and you will be shocked at every 
part of it. 

This cursed letter, no doubt, is 
from the young Levite, whom 
thou. Jack, descrihedat, as making 
inquiry of Mrs. Smith about Miss 
Harlowe's character and visitors.* 

I believe I was a quarter of an 
hour in reading it: fori made it, 
though not a short one, six times' 
as long as it is, by the additions of 
oaths and curses to every pedantic 
line. Lord M. too helped to 
lengthen it, by the like ezecra- 



* aeev.S&i^Vwit 



tions. And thou, Jack, wilL have 
asmucLreason tocurseit as we. 

You cannnt but see, said the 
colonel, yiben 1 had done reading 
it, that thiBfellowhaabeen ii/yfci'ouj' 
in his malevolence; for what he 
saya ie mere hearaay, and that 
hearaay conjectural scandal, 
without fact, or the appearance 
of fact, to support it; bo tbatan 
nnprejudiced eye, upon the face 
of the letter, would condemn the 
writer of it , as I did , and acquit 
my cousin. But yet, such ia the 
Bpiritby which the rest of my rela- 
tions are governed , that they run 
away with the belief of the worst 
itinsinnates, and the dear creature 
has had shocking letters upon it; 
the pedant's hints are taken . and 
a voyage to one of the colonies 
has been proposed to her, as the 
only way to avoid Mr. Belford and 
you. I have not seen these letters, 
indeed; but they took a pride in 
repeating aome of their contents, 
which must have cut the poor aoul 
to the heart; and these, joined to 
her former sufferinga — what have 
you not, Mr. Lovelace, to answer 
for? 

Jju'el. Wbolhedevilconldhave 



there could be parents so impla- 
cable? Brother and sister so

body? — And what now can be

lus cousin. And by her last letter, 
it runs in my mind , that she bai 
some thoughts of forgiving all 
that's past. Do you thinK, colonel, 
if there should not be such a thing 
as a reconciliation going faiwara 
at present, that her letter may oot- 
imnl^, that if we t^'iu/fJ bring sQcli 
a Uiing to bear with her friends, 
she would be reconciled withMr. 
Lovelace? 

C'll. Such an artifice would 
better become the Italian aub- 
tility, than the English sii 
Your lordship has been it 
presume? 

Loeel. My lord has read Boc- 
.caccio, perhaps; and that's as 
well, aa to the hint he gives, which 
may be borrowed from one of that 
author's stories. But MisaCIfliTisrt 
Harlowe is above all artifice. Shs 
must have some meaning I a 
fathom. 

Col. Well, my lord, I can only 
say, that I will make soineuseof 
the letters Mr. LoreJace baa ob- 
liged me with: and after 1 b 
had some talk with my oouria 
James, who is hourly expected) 
and when 1 have dispatched two 
or three affairs that press upon 
me; 1 will pay myrespecta toBiy 
dear cousin; and shall then H 
able to form a bet 
things. Me3ntim< 
her; for 1 have a 
about her, and find she wanU 
consolation. 

Ltivel- If you favour me, co- 
lonel, with the d— n'd letter of 
that fellow Brand, for a day o 
two, you will oblige me. 

Col. Iwill, but remember, itj 



^najt isaparson, Mr.Lovelace; an 
iBaocent one too they eaj. Else 
1 had been at him before now. 
AAd these college novices^ who 
think thej know everj thing in 
their cloisters , and that all learn- 
ing lies in bouts, make dismal 
figureB when they come into the 
world among inen and icnrnen. 

Lord M. Brand! Bniiid! It 
should have been Firebraml , I 
tbiiikf inmy conscience! 

Thua ended thia doughty con- 
ference. 

1 cannot say, Jack, hut I am 
greatly taken with Col. Morden. 
He is bravo and gecerona, and 
knowB the world; and then biB 
contempt of the jiaraonn ia a 
t&in Eign that he is one of us. 

We parted with great civi 
Liord U. (not a little pleased that 
wo did, and as greatly taken with 
the colonel) repeated his wish, 
after the colonel was gone, that 
he had arrived in time to save the 
lady; if that would have done it. 

I wish so too. For, by my aonl, 
Jack, I am every day more and 
more uneaay about her. Butlhope 
she is not BO ill as I am told she is. 

IhavemadeCharlotte transcribe 
the letter of thia Firehranil, as my 
lord calls him; and will inclose 
her copy of it. All thy phlegm 1

ance when thou rcadest it, 

I know not what to adi'ise as

and for their proposal to her of

Confound them all — but if I

One word more, as to a matter of 
erudiliun, which yougreatlylove 
to hear me start, and dwellupiin. 
Dr. Lewen once, in your pre- 
sence, (as yon, my good patrnti, 
eanuot but remember) in a, 
siurtrliii kind of debate be- 
tween hint and me, took upon 
him to censure thejiarmlhetical 
style, as I call it. He was a very 
learned and judicious man, to 
be sure, and an ornament to niir 
functitin: but yet I must needs 
say, that it is a style which 1 
greatly lilte ; and the good doc- 
tor was then past his yiuth, and 
that time of life, of consequence, 
when a fertile {maifmatiim, and 
i-ich faniy, pour in ideas ao fast 
Qpon a writer, that parentheses 
are often wanted (and that for 
the salie of hrecity, as well as 
perspicuity) to save the reader 
the trouble of reading apassage 
more than iiace. Every man to 
his talent (as 1 said before). We 
are all so apt to set up our

As soon as I had run through 
your letters, and the copy of that 
of theineeodiay Branrfs, (by the 
latter of which Isaw to what cause 
a great deal of this last implaca- 
bleness of the Harlowe family is 
owing) I took coach to Smith's, 
although 1 had been come irom 
thence but about imhour, andhad 
taken leave of the lady for the 
night. 

I sent down for Mrs. Lovicfc, and 
desired her, in the firatplace, to 
acquaint the lady (who was busied 
in ber closet) that I had letters 
from Berks; in which 1 was in- 
formed that the interview between 
Col. Morden and Mr. Lovelace had 
ended without ill consequences^ 
that the colonel intended to write 
to her very soon, and was bterest- 
ing himself meanwhile in her fa- 
vour, with her relations: that I 
hoped, that this agreeable news 
would be the means of giving her 
good rest; and I would wait upon 
her in the morning, by the time 
she should return from prayers, 
with all the particulars. 

She sent me word, that ahe 
sliould be glad to aee me in the 
morning; and was highly obliged

she bad for giving that fellow

Byllabub in them , from the cream, 
in what one could and rrmld nni

since four pnrts out of six of thj 
letters, which I thought enter-

appeared to me, when I would 
have read them to her, most ab- 
ominable atuif, and gave mea very 
contemptible idea of thy talents, 
and of my own judgment. 

She was far from rejoicing, ae 
I had done, at the disappointment 
her letter gave you when 
plained. 

She said, nhe meant only ai 
nocent allegory, which might 
carry instruction and warning to 
you, when the meaning was taken, 
a,e well as answer her own bopcf 
for the time. It was run off in « 
hurry. She was afraid it was not 
quite right in her. But hoped the 
end would excuse [if it could not 
justify) the means. And then she 
again expressed a good deal of 
apprehension, lest you should still 
t^e it into your head to molest 
her, when her time, she said, was 
BO short, that she wanted every 
moment of it; repeating what she 
bad said once before, that when 
she wrote, she was so ill, that she 
believed she should not have lived 
till now. If she had thought she 
should, she must have studied for 
an expedient that would have 
better answered her intentions.

knowledge of ua both.

Nor think me , my dear cousin,

eiven Mr. Lovelace no reason to 
think me a weak creature. If I 
Imd, aman of his character might 
have thought himself warranted 
to endeavour to take ungeneroue 
advantage of the weakness he 
had been able to inspire. The 
consciousness ofmgoipii weakness 
(in that case) might have brought

that is, because 1 think his crimes 
have set me above him. Caul be

'Tie evident, that she sat down 
to write this letter with a design 
to mialead and deceive. And if 
she be capable of that, at such a

was, at such an object as was the 
subject of my former letter; who

piece with thy generosity to thy 
Rosebud and her Johnny ; and to 
a number of other good actions, 
in pecuniary matters: although 
thy Rosebud's is, I believe, the 
only instance, where a pretty' 
woman was concerned, of such a 
disinterested bounty. 

Upon my faith, Lovelace, I love 
topraisethee; and often and often, 
as thou knowest, have I studied for 
occasions to do it : insomuch, that 
when for the life of me I could not 
think of any thing done by thee 
that deserved praise, I have taken 
pains to applaud the not ungrace- 
ful manner in which thou hast 
performed actions that merited 
the gallows. 

Now thou art so near, I will 
dispatch my servant to thee if 
occasion recjuires. But, I fear, I 
shall soon give thee the news thou 
apprehendest. For I am just now 
sent for by Mrs. Smith; who has 
ordered the messenger to tell me, 
that she knew not if the lady will 
be alive when I come. 

Friday, Sept. 1. Two o'clock at Smith's. 

I COULD not close my letter in 
such an uncertainty as must have 
added to your impatience. For 
you have, on several occasions, 
convinced me , that the suspense 
you love to give, would be the 
greatest torment to you that you 
could receive. A common case with 
all aggressive and violent spirits, 
I believe. I will just mention then 
(your servant waiting here till I 
nave written) that the lady has 
had two very severe fits: in the 
last of which whilst she lay, they 



sent to the doctor and Mr. God- 
dard , who both advised that a 
messenger should be dispatched 
for me, as her executor; bebg 
doubtful whether, if she had a 
third, it would not carry her off. 

She was tolerably recovered by 
the time I came; and the doctor 
made her promise before me, that, 
while she was so weak, she would 
not attempt any more to go 
abroad; for, by Mrs. Lovick's 
description who attended her, the 
shortness of her breath, her ex- 
treme weakness , and the fervour 
of her devotions when at church, 
were contraries, which, pulling 
different ways, (the soul aspiring, 
the body sinking) tore her tender 
frame in pieces. 

So much for the present. I shall 
detain Will no longer than just to 
beg , that you will send me back 
this packet, and the last. Your 
memory is so good, that once 
reading is all you ever give, or 
need to give, to any thing. And 
who but ourselves can make oirf 
our characters, were you inclined 
to let any body see what passes 
between us? Ifl cannot be obliged, 
I shall be tempted to with-nold 
what I write till 1 have time to take 
a copy of it. * 

A letter from Miss Howe is just 
now brought by a particular mes- 
senger, who says he must carry

when thej are to do good, tiiev 
are to require joor consent. 

How me dear creature's char- 
acter rises in erery line of tfaj 
letters! but it is owing to the on- 
common occasions she has met 
with that she blazes ont npon as 
with soch a meridian lostrer How, 
but for those occasions, could her 
noble sentiments, her prudent 
consideration, her forgiving spirit, 
her exalted benevolence, and her 
equanimity in view of the most 
shocking prospects, 'which set her 
in a light so superior to ail her sex, 
and even to the philosophers of 
antiquity) have been manifested? 

I EDOW thou wilt think I am 
going to claim some merit to 
mysdf, for having given her such 
opportunities of signalizing her 
virtues. But I am not; for, if I did, 
I must share that merit with her 
implacable relations, who would 
justly be entitled to two-ildrds of 
it, at least : and my soul disdains 
a partnership in any thing with 
such a family. 

But this I mention as an answer 
to thy reproaches that I could be 
so little edified by the perfections, 
to which thou supposest, I was for 
so long together daily and hourly 
a personal witoess — when admir- 
able as she was in all she said, and 
in all she did, occasion had not at 
that time ripened, and called forth 
those amazmg perfections which 
now astonish ana confound me. 

Hence it is , that I admire her 
more than ever; and that my love 
for her is less personal^ as I may 
gay, more intellectual, than ever I 
thought it could be to woman. 



Hence als^ :t is, thak I am eon- 
fident would it please the Fates 
to spare her, and make her mine) 
I could love her with a purity thtt 
would draw on auf omm Fcnras, ts 
well as ensure Ker TaaomAL hap- 
piness. — And henee, bjneeessaiy 
consequence, shall 1 be the most 
miserable of all men, if 1 am de- 
prived of her. 

Thou severely reflectest iqMm 
me for my levity; the Abbey in- 
stance in thine eye, I suppose. 
And I will be ingenuous enongh 
to own, that as thou seestnotmy 
heart , there may be passages, in 
every one of my letters, which (the 
; melancholy occasion considered) 
I deserve thy most pointed rebukes. 
i But, faith. Jack, thou art such a 
tragi -comical mortal, with thy 
leaden aspirations at one time, 
and thy flying hour-glasses and 
i dreaming terrors at another, that, 
as Prior says. What serious iSj thu 
turri'st to farce; and it is impos- 
sible to keep within the bounds 
of decorum or gravity, when one 
reads what thou writest. 

But to restrain myself, (for mj 
constitutional gaiety was ready to 
run away with me again) I will 
repeat, I must ever repeat, that 
I am most egregiously affected 
with the circumstances of the 
case: and, were this paragon 
actually to quit the world!, should 
never enjoy myself one hour to- 
gether, though I were to live to 
the age of Methusalem.

Sat motnlag, Stpl, 
I HAVE some little pleasure given 
me by thine, just now brought me.

for the dear lady's sake, as well aa 
for thy own , that thou hadst

The lady ia alive, and serene, 
and calm, and baa all her noble 
intellects clear and strong: but 
nineteen will not however save her. 
She says, she will ni^w content her- 
self with her closet duties, and the 
visits of the parish minister; 
will not attempt to go out. Nor, 
indeed, will she, I am afraid, ever 
walk up or down a pair of Etairs 



I a 



JOrry at my soul to have 
ly : but it would be a folly 



this to say 
to flatter thee. 

Aa to thy seeing her, I believe 
the least hint of that sort, now, 
would cut off some houra of her 
life. 

What baa contributed 
serenity, it seems, ia that taking 
the alarm her fits gave her, she 
has entirely finisbed, and signed 
and sealed, her last will: which 
she had deferred doing till tbis; 
time, in hopes, as she said, of some i 



good news from Harlowe Place, 
nhich would have induced her [o 
alter some passages in it. 

KIJEsHowe's letter wasnot given 
her till foor in the aftemoon, 
yesterday; at which time the 
messenger returned fbrananswer. 
She admitted faim into her pre- 
sence in the dining- room, ill asshe 
then was, and she would have 
written a few lines, aadeairedby 
Miss Howe; but not being able to 
hold a pen, ahe bid themeBaenget 
tell her, that she hoped to be w«ll 
enough to write a long letter bj 
ueit day's post; and wonla 
□o<v detain him. 



CALLED just now, and foiml, 
the lady writing to Miss Hoha 
She made me a melancholy con- 
>liment, that she shewed me not 
liss Howe's letter, because I 
hould soon have that and all bet 
papers before me. But she toU 
me, that Miss Ho we bad very oo*' 
siderately obviated to Coloid 
Morden several things which 
might have occasioned misappl*- 
benstons between him and m»\ 
and had likewise put aligbter con- 
struction, for the aake ofpeace,ei 
some of your actions, taaa tb«r 
deserved. 

She added, that her counn 
Morden was warmly engaged in 
her favour with her friends; and 
one good piece of neirs Hio 
Howes letter contained; that bet

to yoa, in faopCB Ibai'i'ru also are 
better. If thia be granted to my 

froj^era, I shall again be happy. 
write with still the more alacrity, 
aa I have an opportunity pivenme 
to tODch upon a subject in which 
yoa are nearly concerned. 

You must know then, my dear, 
that your cousin Morden has been 
here with me. He told me of an 
interview he had on Monday at < 
Lord M.'s with Lovelace; and 
asked me abundance of qnestiooB 
about you , and about that 
viilainoua man. 

I could have raised a fine flame 
between them if I would: but, 
observing that he is a man of very 
livelv passiona, and believing you 
would be miserable if any thiug 
should happen to him from a 
quarrel with a man who is known 
to have so many advantages athis 
aword, I made not the worst of the 
subjects we talked of. Bi 
could not tell untruths 
favour, you must think I said 
enough to make him curse the 
wretcli. 

I don't find, well as they used to 
respect Colonel Morden, that he 
has influence enough upon them 
to bring them to any terms of re- 
conciliation. 

What can they mean by it? — 
But your brother ia come home, it 
seems; so, the honour of the house, 
the reputation of the family, is all 
the cry 1 

The colonel ia exceedingly out 
of humour with them all. Yet has 
he not hitherto, it seems, i 
jfoar bmtal hrolhei. I told 



how ill yon were, i 
cated to him eome of the content! 
of your letter. He admired yau, 
cursed Xdcefarc. and raved against 

all your family, — He declared, 
that they were all unworthy <» 
yon. 

At his earnest request, 1 per- 
mitted him to take some brirf 
notes of such of the contents ofi 
your letter to rae, as I thought I 
cimlil read to him; and, particu- 
larly, of your melancholy 
elusion.* 

Me says, that none of yoni 
friends think yon so ill as yoa AM| 
nor will believe it. He is mii 
they all love you, and that dea^ 

If they do , their present Iwrd-

The colonel (as one of your

and, iu the meantime, he ha 
actually engaged them to reinit ti 
him for ^ou l£e prodnce of it ac

led to diatreaayou, and to put

lour cousin imagines, that, 

^Tre a reconciliation takes pi ace, 
r will ineiat, that you shall 
:esiich a will, as to that estate, 
a they ahall approve of; but he 
declares, he will not go out of 
England till he has seen justice 
done you by eaery l/ody; and that 



yon shall not be imposed on either 
by friend or foe — 

IJy relation or foe, should he not 
have said ? — For a friend will not 
impoae upon a friend. 

So, my dear, you are trf Any ji'cr 
peace, if some people are to have 
their wills! 

Your cousin [not /, my dear, 
though it was always myopinion"] 
aays, that the whole family ia Ion 
rir/i, to he either himhU, ron- 
«iilerale, or cin/nitaf. And as for 
himaelf , he has an ample fortune, 
he snys, and thinks of leaving it 
wholly to j-ou. 

Had this Tiliain Lovelace con- 
sulted his worldly interest atily, 
what a fortune would he have had 
in yon, even although your marry- 
ing him had lieprived you of a 
paternal share ! 

I am obliged to leave off here. 
But having a good deal still to 
write, ana my mother better, I 
will pursue the subject in another 
letter, although I send both to- 

f ether. 1 need not say how much 
am, and will ever be, 

Your affectionate, &c. 

Ansa Howb. 



The colonel thought fit once, in 
praise of Lofelace'a^enern^fy, to 
aRy,that(a» ammofhnnotiTotiffht) 
he took to himself all the blame,

that there wae no need of any

letters you had written to your 
friends, and which bad been shewn

is to flay, my dear, it any thing 
worse than perjury, broach of 
faith, and abuse of a generous 
confidence, were to appearl — 

Iaorry fellowsl] he would avenge 
lis cousin to the utmost. 

I urged your apprehensiona on 
thia head from your last letter to 
me: but he seemed capable of 
taking what I kuow to be real 
greatness of Goul, in an unworthy 
sense: for he meutioned directly 
upon it, the eipectatiou your 
friends had, that you should (pre- 
vious to any reconciliation with 
them) appear in a court of justice 
against the villain — If you could 
do it with the advantage to your- 
self that I hiuted might be done. 

And truly.ifl would havebeard 
him, he had indelicacy euougli to 



have gone into the nature of the 
proof of the crime upon which thsj 
wanted to have Lovelace a^ 
raigned. Yet thia is a man im- 

B roved by travel and learning! —

have been accustomed t« the moM 
delicate conversation ever nncefl 
had the honour to know yon, (JM 
apiae this sei from the gentlemllF 
down to the peasant. 

Upon the whole , I find that Ht, 
Morden has avery slender notim 
of women's virtue, iu particalO' 
cases: for which reason I pot bin 
down, though yourfavourite, at 
one who is not entitled tn cant (1* 
fivKtsUme. 

I never knew a man who de- 
served to be well thougbt of hin- 
self for his morals, who biid I 
alight opinion of the virtue rf 
our ses in general. For if, ftolft 
the difference of leniperamait Iiii 
eiJucaiiitn, modesty, chastity, md 
piety too, are not to be fotmdJI 
our aex preferable to the other, I 
should tnink it a sign of AintN 
worse nature in ours.

I vroKCEs not at the impatience 
your servant tells me you express 
to bcur from me. I was designiuf 
to write you a loDg tetter, am 
was just returned from Smith' 
for tbat purpose; bat since yoi 
are BO urgent, you must be con 
tented with a short one. 

J attended the lady thie morn 
iug, just before I set out for 
Kdgeware. She was bo ill over 
night, that she was obliged t( 
leave unfinished her letter to Mis 
Howe, But early this mominf 
she made an end of it, and bai 
just sealed it up as I came. Shi 
was so fatigued with writing, tbat 
she told me she would lie down 
after I waa gone, and endeavour 
to recruit her apirits. 

They bad sent for Mr. Goddard, 
when she was so ill last night; 
and Hot being able to see nim 
out of her own chamber, he, for 
the first time, saw her house as 
she calls it. He was extremely 
shocked and concerned at it; and 
chid Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick 
for not persuading her to have 
such an object removed from ' 
bed-chombei': and when they 



cused themselves on the lillU 
itharity it was reasonable to suu- 
poae they must have with a lady 
so much their superior, here- 
fleeted warmly ou those whohad 
re authority, and who lefther 
proceed with such a shock- 
; and solemn whimsy , as be 
lied it. 

It is placed near the windo*. 
like a harpsichord, thoiieh covered 
to the ground: and wbenshe 
ill , tbat she cannot well go 
to her closet, she writes and reads 
upon it, SB othera would uponi 
desk or table. But (only aa ahe 
ill last night) she cfaooau 
tee any body in that apart 

I went to Edgewttre; aud, re- 
turning in the evening, attended 
her again. She bad a letter 
brought her from Mrs. Norton (a 
long one, as itseemsby ilsbnlk'i 
just before I came. But sbehni) 
not opened it; and said, thatw 
she was pretty calm and com- 
posed, ahewas afraid to loolcinli) 
the contents, lest she should be 
ruflled; expecting, now, to liev 
of nothbg that could do her good 
or give her pleasure firom thtl 
good woman's dear hard-hear^ti 
neighbours., as she called het own 
relations. 

Seeing her so weak and ill. ' 
withdrew, nor did she desire »>''

her pleasure and spirits; and 
being a necessary preparation,

that he beheved she wonld hold

friends to have notice of her state, 
and to see her, and hardW longer; 
and since he could not find, that 
she bad any certainty of aeeing

it plain that her relations con-

rememher the linea of Howard, 
which once you read to me in my 
ivy bower?* 

Id the diapoaition of what be- 
loDgB to me, I have CDdeavoured 
to do every thing in the justest 
and beat manner Icould think of: 
putting myself in my relations 
places, and in the greater points, 
ordering my matters, as if no mis- 
understanding had happened. 

I hope they mil not think much 
of some bequests where wanted, 
and where due from my gratitude: 
but if they should, what is done, 
iadone; and I cannot now help it. 
Yet I must repeat, that I hope, I 
hope, 1 have pleased every oue of 
them. For I would not, on any 
account, have it thought, that, 
in my last disposition , anything 




. should have had place 
in a mind that is so truly A'ee (as I 
will presume to say) from all re- 
sentment, that it now overflows 
with gratitude and blessings for 
the good I have received, althongh 
it be not all that ray heart wished

thatlwas not favoured with more, 
what is it but an hardship of half 
a year, against the mnsi indulgent 
goodness of eighteen years and 
an half, that ever was shewn to a 
daughter? 
My cousin, you tell me, thinks 
was off my guard, and that I was 
taken at some disadvantage. In- 
deed, my dear, I was not. Indeed 
I gave no room for advantage to 
he taken of me. 1 hope, one day, 
that will be seen, it I have the 
justice done me which Mr. Belford 

I should hope, that my cousin 
hasnottaken the liberties, which 
you, (by an observation nut, in. 
geueral, unjnet) seem to charge 
him with. For it is sad to think, 
that the generality of that sex 
should make so light of crimes, 
which they justly hold so unpar- 
donable in their own most in- 
timate relations of ours — yet 
cannot conimitthem without doing 
such injuries to other families aa 
they thiuk themselves obliged to 
resent unto death, when offered 

But we women are too often to 
blame on this head; since themost 
virtuous among us seldom make 
virtue the test of their approbation

jaar penitence; your ill health; 
your virtue, though once betrayed, 
and basely used ; he then read to 
them Mr. Lovelace's letter, a most 
contrite one indeed*; and your 
ir^ft-sDu/eii answer**; for that was 
what he justly called it; and he 
treated as it deserved Mr. Brand's 
officious information (of which, 1 
had before heard, he had made 
them ashamed) by representations 
fonnded upon inquiries made by 
Mr. Alston***, whom he had pro-

quaint himself with your manner

dear, adi'm," are you words — 

0, my child! my childl said 
your mamma, weeping, and clasp- 
■-ig her hands. 

Dearmadam, said your brother, 
e so good as to think you have

Yet your siater seemed af- 

Your uncle Harlowe, wiping 
bis eyes, O cousin, said he, if one 
thonghtthe poor girl was really so 



ill 

She mmt, said your uncle An- 
tony. This is written to her pri- 
vate friend. God forbid she should 
be quite lostl 

Your uncle Harlowe wished they 
did not carry their resentments 

I begged, for Kod's sake, wring- 
ing my hands, and with a bonded 
knee, that they would permit me 
to go up to you; eugagmg to give 
them a faithful account of the way 

{ou were in. But I was chidden 
y your brother; and this occa- 
sioned some angry words between 
him and Mr. Morden. 

I beheve , sir, I believe, madam, 
said your sister , to her father and 
mother, we need not trouble my 
cousin to read any more. It does 
but grieve and disturb you. My 
sister Clary seems to be ill: I think, 
if Mrs. Norton were permitted to 
go up to her, it would be right. 
Wickedly as she has acted, ifshe 
be truly penitent — 

Here she stopt; and every one 
being silent, 1 stood up once more, 
aud besought them to let lue govj

and then i offered to read a pas- 
sage or two in your letter to me of 
the 24th. Butlwastakeu up again 
by your brother; and this occa- 
sioned still hicber words bctneen 
the colonel and him. 

Your mother, hoping to gain 
upon your infleiible brother , and 
to divert the anger of the two 
gentlemen from each other, pro- 
poHcd that the colonel should pro- 
ceed in reading the minutes he 
had taken from yout letter. 

He accordingly read, "Of your 
resuming your pen; that you 
thought you bad taken your last 
farewell; and tlie reet of that very 
affecting passage, in which you 
are obliged to break off more than 
once and afterwards to take an 
airing in a chair." Your brother 
and sister were affected at this; 
and he had recourse to his saxiS- 
box. And where you comfort Miss 
Howe, and aay, "You shall be 
happy;" Itifi more, said he, than 
Bbe will let any body elae be. 

Your sister called you, aweet 
eoul! but with a low voice: then 



affected by your pathetic grief 
but that it was your talent. 

The colonel then went on to the 
good effect your airing had upon 
you; to your good wiBhea to Miaa 
Howe and Mr. Hickman; aud to 
your concluding sentence, that 
when the happy life you wished to 
her cornea to be wound up, she 
may be as calm aud as easy at 
quitting it, as you hope in G ' 
you shall be. Your mother co 
aot stand this; but lettred ti

comer of the room, and sobbed, 
and wept. Your father for a few 
minutes could not speak, though 
he seemed inclined to say aoine' 

Your uncles were also both af' 
fected ; — but your brother went 
round to each; and again reminded, 
yoiu' mother that she had olbw 
children: what was there, he said, 
ID what was read, but the result 
of the talent you had of movhij 
the passions? and he blamed them 
for choosing to hear read what 
they knew their abused induIgenoK

Jour part in her education, aa to 
er fttmily, ia a weakness that 
would induce one to suspect your 
virtue if you were to be encount-

By some such charitable logic,

I li^oubt not. If to be uncharitable

"f virtue, you, Mr. James Har-

I J knew how it would be , replied 
■our brother, in a passion . if I 
t Mr. Morden upon this busi- 
nesa. X would liave declined it: 
but you, sir, to his father, would 
not permit me so to do. 

But, sir, turning to the colo-

sir, — and the son and nephew of

ouraelrea, when the villain lives 
Ibatonght to be the object of every 
one's roaentmeut, who has either 
a value for the family, or for this 
luurratefnl girl? 

That's the man , said your cou- 
sin, whom last Monday, as you 
know. I went purposely to make 
the object of mine. But what could 
I aS7i when I found bim so willing 



247 

to repair his crime? — And I give 
itasmy opinion, and have written 
accorduigly tomypoorcousin,that 
it is best for all round, that his 
oSer should be accepted^ and let 
me tell you — 

Tell me nothing, said your fa- 
ther, quite enraged, of tbatvery 
vile fellow I I have a riveted 
hatred to him. I would rather see 
the rebel die an hundred deaths, 
were it poesible, than that she 
should give such a villain as him 
a relation to my family. 

Well, but there is no room to

wears told sheis, let us send Mrs. 
Norton up to her. — That's the 
ieasi we can do — let us take her, 
however, out of the hands of that 
Belford. 

Both your uncles supported this 
motion ; the latter part of it espe- 

Your brother observed, in his 
ill-natured way, what a fine piece 
of consiateucy it was, in you, to 
refuse the vile injurer, and the 
amends he offered; yet to throw 
yourself upon the protection of his 

Miss Harlowe was apprehen-

to approve of it. But your brother 
dashed all. I hope, sir, said he, 
to bis father; I hope, madam, to 
his mother; that you irill not 
endeavour to recover a faulti 



ever my sister Clary darkens thes^ 
doors again, I never will. I will 
set out, madam, the same hour 
you go to London (on such an er- 
rand) to Edinburgh; and there 
I will reside; and try to forget 
that I have relations in England 
so near and so dear as you arenow 
all to me. 

Good God, said the colonel, 
what a declaration is this ! — And 
BUppoHe, sir, and suppose, ma- 
dam, [turning to your father and 
mother] this slimild be the case, 
whether is it better, think you, 
that you should loae for ever such 
a daughter aa my cousin Clarv, or 
that your sou should go to Ediu- 
hurgh, and reside there upon an 
estate which will be the better for 
for hia residence upon it. 

Youi' brother's passionate be- 
haviour hereupon is hardly to be 
described, ile reaented it aa pro- 
moting an alienation of the aaec-', 
tian oftbe family to him. Avdto' 



such a height wei'e resentments 
carried, every one siding with 
him, that the colouel, with hands 
and eyes lifted up, cried ont, what 
hearts of Sint am 1 related to! —

ther,^ are youreaolved to have' '^

The colonel turned from . 
to draw out his handkerchief, and 
could not for a minute spealb Tbe 
eyea of every one but the hard- 
hearted brother, caught tosM 
from his. 

But then turning to them (with 
the more indignation, asitseemsd, 
as he had been obliged to ibews 
humanity, which, bowever, M 
bravo heart should be asbaiiHJ 
of) I leave ye all, said he, fit 
company for one another. Iwill

And saying this, he burned 
of the room, went into the oOOit- 
yard, and ordered his horse. 

Mr. Antony Hariowe went

since 1 h.tre been in England : but 
I have been so treated by that 
hot-heiided young man (who, as 
far as I know, has done more to 
ruin his sister than Lovelace him- 
eelf, and iHi with the arprobation 
of you all) that I will not again 
enter into ijovr doors, or Ibeiis. My 
servants shall have orders whither 
to bring what belongs to me from 
your house. I will see my dear]

to your grief.

of US one word to the other. At 
last she broke HJIence, asking me, 
if you were really and indeed bo 
illasit wasiaid you were? 

I answered in the affirmative; 
and would have shewn her your 
laat letter; but she declined Boe- 
ing it. 

Iwould fain have procured from 
her the favour of a line to yon, 
with her hleaaing. 1 asked, what 
was intended by your brother and 
sister? would nothine satisfy them 
but your final reprobation? — I 
insinuated, how easy it would be, 
did not your duty and humility 

fovem you, to make yourself in- 
ependent as to circumstances; 
but that nothing but a blessing, a 
last blesaing, was re quests Q by 
you. And many other things I 
urged in your behalf. The fol- 
lowing brief repetition of what she 
was pleased to say in answer to 
TQJ pleas, will give you a notion 
of it all; and of the present aitua- 
tionof tbings. 

She said, "She was very un- 
happy! — She had lost the little 
authority she once had over her 
other children, through one child's 
failing; and all iuSuence over Mr. 
Harlowe and bis brothers. Your 
father, she said, had besought her 
to leave it to hhn to take his own 
methods with you: and (as she 
valued him) to take no step in 
your favour nnknown to him and 
your uncles: yet she owned, that 
they were too much governed by 
your brother. They would, how- 
ever, give way in time, she know, 
toazeeoadliaitio^i: theydeaigaed| 



) other ; for they all still loved 



you. 

"Your brother and sister, she 
owned, were very jealousof your 
coming into favour aeain: yet 
could but Mr. Morden have kept 
his temper, and stood her son's 
first sallies, who (having alwayi 
had the family grandeur in view) 
had carried bis resentment h 
high, that be knew not how to 
descend, the conferences, so ab- 
ruptly broken off just now, wonid 
have endedmoTO happily; for tlut 
she had reason to think, that a 
few concessions on your part, 
with regard to your grandfatlier'i 

gaging for your submission 
from pro/ier motives, would bars 
softened them all. 

"Mr. Brand's account of your 
intimacy with the friend of the 
obnoxious man, she said, had, Sit 
very unhappy effectsr 
for before that she had gainea 
ground ; but afterwardi 
dared not, nor indeed had inclina- 
tion, to open her lips in youi be- 
half. Your continued intimaey 
with that Mr. Belford was wholly 
unaccountable, and as wholly ii 
excusable. 

"What made the wished-fbi 
reconciliation, she said, more dif- 
ficult, was, first, that you yooi- 
self acknowledged yourself «^ 
honoured (and it was too wdl 
known, that it was ^our own fault 
that you ever were m thi 
BO great a profligate) ; 
quence, that tbeu- and yoor dl>-<

aecDte the wretch. Nert, that the 
pardon &nd bleaaing hoped for, 
mnst probably be Btteuiftd with 
TOnr marriage to the man they 
hate, and who hates them as 
much: very dia agreeable circum- 
stances, she said, I must allow, to 
found a reconciliation upon. 

"As to her own part, she must 
needs say, thatifthere were ajiy 
hope that Mr. Lovelace would 
become a, reformed man, the letter 
her cousin Morden had read to 
them from him to you, and the 
justice (as she hoped it was) he 
did your chamcter, though to his 
own condemnation (Mb family 
and fortunes being unexception- 
able) and all his relatioua earnent 
to be related to you, were argu- 
ments that would have weight 
with her, could they have any 
with your father and uncles." 

To my plea of your illness. 
" She could not but flatter herself, 
she answered, that it was from 
lowness of spirits, and temporary 
d^ection. A young creature, she 
■Bid, so very considerate as you 
naturally were, and fallen so low,

"^ey lose you, which God forbid! 
Bcene would then indeed be 
iy changed; for then those 
moat reaen ted, would be 



brance, and your unhappy eiTor 
woald be quite forgotten. 

" She wished you would put 
yourself into your cousin's protec- 
tion entirely, and have notbiug 
more to say to Mr. Belford." 

And I would recommend it

your most serious consideration, 
my dear Hiss Clary, whether now, 
aa your cousin (who is your 
trustee for your grandfauier's 
estate) is come, you should not 
give over all thoughta of Mr. 
Lovelace's intimate friend far 
your executor; more eipetnally, 
as that gentleman's interferius m 
the concerns of your family, 
ahould the sad event take place 
(which ray heart aches but to 
think of) might be attended with 
those consequences which you are 
so desirous, in other cases, to ob- 
viate and prevent. And suppose, 
my dear young lady, yon were to 
write one letter more to each of 
your unelea, to let them know 
how ill you are — and to ask their 
advice, and offer to be governed 
by it, in relation to the dispoaition 
ofyour estalo and effects? — Me- 
thinks I wish you would. 

1 find they will send you up a. 
large part of what has been re- 
ceived from that estate , since it 
was yours; together with your cur- 
rent cash, which you left behind 
you: and this by your cousin 
Morden , for fear you should have 
contracted debta which may make 
you nneasy. 

They seem to expect, that you 
will Wish to live at your grand- 
father's house, in a private man-

Nevertheless, in reading it, she 
was forced to leave off several 
times through weakness and a

complained; if 1 may say cnm-

She was very much affected at 
divers parto of this letter. She 
wept several times , and sighed 
often. Mrs. Lovick told me , that 
these were the gentle exclama-

read; — Her unkind, her atiel Sro-

When I was admitted to her

she , a long and not very pleasing 
letter from my dear Mrs. Norton. 
It will soon be in your bands. I 
am advised against appointiug 
you to the office you have so kind- 
ly accepted of: but you must re- 
sentnothing of these things. My 
choice will have no odd appearance 
to them: but it is now too late to 
alterit, if I would. 

I woidd fain write an answer to 
it, continued she: but I have no 
distinct sight, Mr. Belford, no 
steadiness of fingers — this mis- 
tineas however, will perhaps be 
gone hy-aad-by. _ Then turning

1 asked, if I should write to her 
cousin, aa he knew not how ill she 
was, to hasten up? 

By no means, she said ; since, if 
he were not already set out, she 
was persuaded that she should be 
so low by the time he could receive 
my letter, and come, that his pre- 
sence would but discompose and 
hurry her, and afflict him. 

I hope, however, she is uot so 
very near her end. And without 
saymgany more to her, when I 
retired, I wrotetoColonelMorden, 
that if he expects to see his beloved 
cousin alive, he must lose no time 
in setting oat. I sent this letter 
by his own servant.

Tarn urgencj of the case, and 
the opportunity by your servant, 
will Bufiiciently apofogize for this 
troahle from a stranger to your 
person; who, however, is not a 
stranger to yonr merit. 

I understand you are employ- 
ing your good offices, with the 
parents of MissClarissft Uarlowe, 
and other relations, to reconcile 
them to the most meritorious 
daughter and kinswoman that 
ever family had to boast of. 

Generously as this ia intended 
by you, we here have too much 
reason to think all your aolici- 
todea on this head will be un- 
necessary: for it is tlie opinion of 
every one who has the honour of 
being admitted to her preseoce, 
that she cannot live over three 
days: so that if you wish to see 
her alive, you must lose no time to 
come up. 

She knows not that I write. 1 
had done it sooner, if 1 had had 
the least doubt that before now 
dhe would not have received from 
yon some news of the happy 
effects of your kind mediation in 
bar behalf. I am, Sm, 

Your most humble servant,

three or four times a day, re-

ride back; and, in view of Ui-

Yesterday, in particular, to 
give you an idea of the strength 
of that imijatience, which! cannot 
avoid suffering to break out upon 
my servants , 1 h ad no sooner dis- 
patched Will, than I took horse 
to meet him on his return. 

In order to give him time, 1 
loitered abont on the road , riding 
up iMs lane to the one highway, 
down thai to the other, just as my 
horse pointed; all the way curaing 
my very being; and ihoiigh so 
lately looking duwn upon all the 
world, wishing to change condi- 
tionB with the poorest beggar that 
cried to me for charity as I rode 
by him — and throwing him 
money, in hopes to obtain Dj his 
prayers the blessing my heart 
pants after. 

After i had sauntered about an 
hour or two (which seeped three 
or four tedious ones) fearing I had 
alipt the fellow, 1 inquired at 
every turnpike, whether a servant 
in Bucb a livery had not passed 
" jagb in iiis retuiii from Lon-

in so short ft compass! 

Yet all this time, though lonj

sight of the solemn letter the ad-

It was communicated to me by 
Mrs. Lovick; who had it to copy 
for me; but it was not to be de-

account of such sums shall like- 
wise be taken without question- 
ing; the money, however, which I 
left behind me in my escritoire, 
being to be taken in part of those 
disbursements. 

Mv grandfather, who, in his 
goodness and favonrto me, knew 
no bounds, wa^ pleased to be- 
queath to me all the family pic- 
tures at his late house, some of 
which are very masterly perform- 
ances; with command, that if I 
died unmarried, or if married and 
had no descendants, they should 
then go to that son of his (if more 
than one should be then living) 
whom I shonid think would set 
most value by them. Now, as I 
know that my honoured nncle, 
JohnHarlowe, Esq. was pleased 
to express some concern that they 
were not left to him, as eldest son ; 
and as he has agallery where they 
maybeplaced to advantage; and 
as I have reason to believe, that 
he will bequeath them to my fa- 
ther, if he survive him; who, no 
doubt, willleave them to my bro- 
ther; I therefore bequeath all the 
said family pictures to my said 
uncle John Harlowe. In these 
pictures, however, I conclude not 
one of my own, drawn when I was 
aboutfourteenyearsof age; which 
I shall hereafter iu another article 
bequeath. 

My said honoured grandfather

this fomilf plate, which la de-

honoured and enoellent mother, 1 



yearaof ray life, made me beloved

hundred pounds , to be paid her 
within three months after my 
death. 

I bequeath also to the f

To Mrs. Dorothy Hervcy, the

comfort and comforters, 1 have 
had such instances, as that oor

my good Mrs. Norton to be put

be mentioned. 

To the coachman , groom, and 
two footmen, and five maids

pounds each; to the helper, five 
pounds. 

To my siater's maid Betty 
Barnes, I bequeath ten pouada, to 
shew that I resent not lormer dis- 
obligations; which I believe were 
owing more to the insolence of of- 
fice, and to natural pertness , than 
to personal ill-will. 

All my wearing apparel, of 
whatever sort, that I have not 
beenohliged top&rtwttli,or which 
ii not already bequeathed, (my 
lioen eicepted) J desire Mrs. Ni 
ton will accept of.

my clothes are sealed up, 1 desire 



may not be opened, 
sence of Mrs. Norton (or of 






one deputed by her) and of Mrs. 

To the worthy Mrs, Lovick 
above-mentioned, from whom 1 
have received great civilities, and 
even maternal kindnesses : and to 
Mrs, Smith, (with whom 1 lodge) 
ironi whom also I have received 
great kindnesses ; I bequeath all 
my linen, and all my unsold laces; 
to be divided eaually between 
J them, as they shall agree: or, in 
I.Mwe of disagreement, the same to 



be sold, and the money arising to 
be equally shared by them. 

And X bequeath to the same 
two good women, as a further 
token of my thankful acknow- 
ledgements of their kind love and 
compassionate concern for mo, 
the sum of twenty guineas each. 

To Mr. Smith, the husband of 
Mrs. Smith above named, I be- 
queath the sum of ten guineas, in 
acknowledgement of his civilities 

To Katharine, the honest maid- 
servant of Mrs. Smith, to whom 
(having no servant of my own) I 
have Been troublesome, I be- 
queath five guineas; and ten gui- 
neas more, mtieu of asuitofmy 
wearing - apparel , which once, 
with some linen, I thought of 
leaving to her. With this she 
may purchase what may be more 
'■■'•ible to her likingand degree, 
1 the honest and careful 
widow AnneShelhume, my nurse, 
over and above her wa^es, and

careful, and (to persons of such 
humanity and tenderness) a me- i 
lancholy employment, attended 
'— the latter part of life with great 
itching and fatigue, which is 
hardly ever enough considered.

In tbe middle drawer of mj 
eacritgire at Ilarlowe Place, are 
many letters, and copies of letters, 
put up according to their dates, 
which I have written or received 
in a course of years (ever since I 
learned to write) from and to my 
grandfather, my father and mo- 
ther, royuucles, my brother and 
sister, on occasional little ab- 
sences; my late uncle Morden, 
raj cousin Morden; Mrs. Norton, 
and Miss Howe, and other of my 
comiianioiiB and frieuds, before 
my confinement at my father's: 
»s alao from the three reverend 
gentlemen, Dr. Blome. Mr. Arnold, 
ftud Mr. Tomkins now with God, 
and the very reverend Dr. Leweii, 
on serious subjects. As these let- 
ters exhibit a correapondenoe that 
no person of my se: need to be 
ashamed of, allowing for the time 
of life when mine were written; 
and aa many excellent things are 
contained iu tlioae written to me; 
imd as Miss Howe, to whom most 
of them have been communicated, 
wished formerly to have them, if

I bequeath them to my said de^r 
fi-icna Miss Anna Uowc ; and the

past a very conaiderable share in 
Qie correspondence. 

I do hereby make, constitute,

last will and testament; havinf

which induced me to ask tl'

Howe and her mother, to collect 
the particulaj'B of my sad story, 
nnd given espectatiou that I 
would, in order to do my character 
justice with all my iriends and 
companions; but not having time 
before me for the pfiinlul task, it 
has been a pleasore to me to find, 
by extracts kindly communicated 
to me by my said executor, that I 
may safely trust my famf ■ - ■"- - 
justice done me bj-Mr. Li 
in his letters to him my said 
cutor. And an Mr. Belford 
engaged to contribute what 1 
hts poirer towards a, compilement 
to be made of all that relate to 
mj' story, and knows my whole 
miud In this respect, it ia my de- 
sire that he will cause two c 
to be made of this collection 
to remain with Miss Howe, 
other with himself; and that he 
will shew or lend his copy, if re- 

auired, to my aunt Hervey, for 
le satisfaction of any of my fa- 
mily; bat under such restrictions 
as the said Mr. Belford shall think 
fit to impose; that neither any 
other person's safety may be en- 
dangered, nor his own honour 
Bnffer by the communication. 

I bequeath to my said executor 
the snm of one hundred guineas, 
as a grateful though insufficient 
acknowledgment ofthe trouble he 
will be at id the execution of the 
trust he has BO kindly undertaken.

twenty guineas for a ring; and 
that be will reimburse himself for 
all the charges and expenses 
which he shalfbe at in the execu- 
tion of this trust. 

In the worthy Dr. H. I have 
found a physician, a father, and 
a friend. 1 beg of him, as a testi- 
mony of my gratitude, to accept 
of twenty guineas for a ring. 

I have the same obligations to 
the kind and skiliiil Mr. Goddard, 
who attended me as my apothe- 
cary. His very moderate bill I 
have discharged down to yester- 
day. I have always thought it in- 
cumbent upon testators to shorten 
all they cau the trouble of their 
executors. I know I underrate 
the value of Mr. Goddard's at- 
tendances, when over and above 
what may accrue from yesterday, 
to the hour that will linish all, t 
desire fifteen guineas for a ring 
may be presented to him. 

To the reverend Mr. , who 

frequently attended me, and 
prayedby meinmy lastatages, I 
also bequeath fifteen guineas for 

There are a set of honest in- 
digent people, whom I used to call 
myponr, and to whom Mrs. Norton 
conveys relief each month (or at 
shorter peiiodsl in proportion to 
their necessities, from a sum I 
deposited in her bands, and from 
time to time recruited , as means 
accrued to me; but now nearly 
if not wholly expended ; nnw, 
that my fauft may he as little 
aggravated aa possible, by the 



r 



S74 I 

relieve ; and aa the produce of my 
grandfather's eatate (including 
the moiety of the buibb he had by 
him. aua was pleased to give roe 
at his death, as above- mentioned ) 
together with what I shall further 
appropriate to the same us 
Buhaequent articlea, will, aa 1 
hope, more than answer all my 
legacies and bequests; itisroy will 
and desire, that the remainder, 
be it little or much , shall become 
a fund to be appropriated, and 
I hereby direct that it be appro- 
priated, to the hke pnrposes with 
the aums which I put into Mrs. 
Norton's hands as aforesaid — 
and this under the direction and 
management of the aaid Mrs. 
Norton, who knows my whole 
mind in this particular. And in 
caseof her death, or of herdeaire 
to be acquitted of the manage- 
ment thereof, it is my earnest re- 
queat to my dear Miss Howe, that 
she will take it upon herself, and 
that at her own death ahe will 
tranafer what ahall remain undis- 
posed of at the lime, to such per- 
sons, and with such limitations, 
reatrictions, and provisoes, as she 
shall think will best answer my 
intention. For, as to the manage- 
ment and diatiibution of all or 
anypartofit, while in Mra. Nor- 
ton'a hands, or her own; I will, 
that it be entirely discretional, 
and without account, either to my 
executor, orany other person. 

AlthoughMrs. Norton, aa I have 
hinted, knows my whole mind in 
tbia respect; yet it may be proper 
ention, in this last solemn 
that mv intention ia, that 




this fund be entirely set aj. .___ 

appropriated to relieve tempo- 
rarily, from the interest thereof, 
(as I dare say it will be pnt out to 
the best advantage) or evert from 
the principal, if need be, tha 
honeat, industrioita , labonrinf 
poor only: when aicknees, lamb- 
neaa, unforeaeen losses, or othet- 
accidents , disable them fion< 
following their lawful callings; or 
to assist such honest people at 
laree families, as shall have k 
child of good inclinatione to pnt 
out to service, trade, or hus- 
bandry. 

It haa'always been a rule witii 
me, inmy little donations, to en- 
deavour to aid and set forward 
the sober and induatrious poor- 
Small helpa, if aeasonably asord- 
ed, will do for such; and so the 
fund may bo of more eitenstrs 
benefit; an ocean of wealth will 
not be sufficient for the idle aod 
dissolute; whom therefore, sinGB 
they will be always in want, 
will be no charity to relieve, 
worthier creatures woald, by te- 
heving the others, be deprived 
of such assistance as may set the 
wheels of their industry go' 
and put them in a sphere of as 
action. 

But it is my eipress will 
direction, that let this fund c 
out to be ever so considerable, it 
shall be applied only in anpnoit 
of the leniporary exigencies of ths 
persona I have described; i 
that no one family or person 
ceive from it, at oae time or 
year, more than the eum of 



HARLOWE.

what they will, Mr. Belford, the 
first reading a will, where a per- 
son dies worth any thing consider- 
able, generally affords a true test 
of the relationB' love to the de- 
ceased. 

The clothes, the thirty guineas 
for mourning to Mrs. Norton, with 
the recommendation of tbe good 
woman for housekeeper at Ok 
Gr'iiie, were thought sufficient, 
had the article of 6fflV. which was 
called monstrous, been omitted. 
Some other passages in the will 
were called flighls, and nucA lehm- 
iies as diatinguiak people ofanagi- 
naiitm from those of judgment. 

My cousin Dolly Hervey was 
erudged the library. Miss Har- 
lowe said, that as she and her 
sister never bought the name 
books, she would take that to her- 
self, and would male il up to her 
cousin Dolly one way or vlher. 

I intend, Mr, Belford, to save 
you tbe trouble of interposing 
— the library stall be my consin 
Dolly's. 

Mrs. Hervey could hardly keep 
her seat. On ihii occasion, how- 
ever, she only said, that her late 
dear and ecer dear niece was loo 
good to her and hern. But, al an- 
olhei- lime, she declared with teaft; 
that she could not forgive herself 
for a letterahewrofe,* looking at 
Miaa Arabella, frhom, it seema, 
unkuonrn to any body, she had 
consulted before she wrote it, and 
which, she said, must have 
wounded a spirit, that now, she 
saw, had beentoo deeply wounded 
before.

This collection having ma into 
a much ^'eater length than was 
wished, it is thought proper to 
omit several letters that passed 
botwecD Col. Morden, Mi<isUowe, 
Mr. BeUord, and Mr. Hickman, in 
relation to the esecution of the 
lady's will, &c. 

It is however necessary to oV 
s<?rve on this subject, that the un- 
happy mother, being supported by 
the two uncles, influenced the 
afflicted father to overrule ail his 
sou's objections, nud to direct a 
literal observation ofthewill- and 
at the same time to give up all the 
sums which he was empowered by 
it to reimburse himself; as also to 
take upon himself to defray the 
^ncral eipcnses . 

Mr. Belford so mucb obliged 
Miss Howe by bis steadiness^ 
equity, and dispatch, and bj his 
n>ndine>s lo contrilnite to" the of 
dIrectMt colWUiui. that she volon- ' 



tative of her beloved friend. In 
thccoursGof which, becommuni- 
cated to her (in confidence) the 
letters which passed betweenhtm 
and Mr. Lovelace, and, by Colonel 
Mordcn's consent, those which 
passed between that gentleman 
and himself. 

Ue sent with the first parcel of 
letters which he had transcribed 
out of short hand for Ittiaa Howe, a 
letter to Mr. Hickman, dated the 
IGth of September, in wluch he 
expresses himself as follows : 

" But I ought, sir,ia this pared, 
to have kept out one letter. It i* 
that which relates to the interriew 
between yoorself and Mr. Love- 
lace, at Mr. Dormer's.* In wfaioli 
Mr. Lovelace treata you with an 
air of levity, which neither yoar 
person , your character , aor TOOT 
commission deserved; but inuck 
was his iisfjai wag oflrvatrngtitft 
one ickose businesshetcasnot phaM

much greatness of mind to bidh^ 
turbed at the contents of this letter, 
shonld Miss Howe commiiniGate 
them to you; and the rather, vit 
is impossible that youahonldsttfo I 
with her on that account" 

Mr. Belford then en 
Lovelace, as a goodnatured m 




stanceaof his still greater fri 

with himself. 

To this Mr. Hickman anmreni 

in his letter of the 18th:

vou, that I hate your whole sex for

characters, whom at those times I 
connot but look upou as persons I 
have not yet found out.

J'swels be sent up to you for sale,

Dut I must not touch upon the

Mr. Belford, in his answer, pro- 
mises, that she shall be the pur- 
chaaer of the jewels, if they come 
into bis bands. 

He acquaints her, that the fa- 
mily had given Col. Morden the 
keys of all that belonged to the 
dear departed: that the unhappy 
motbor had (as the will allows) 
ordered a piece of needlework to 
be set aside for her, and had 
desired Mrs, Norton to get the 
little book of meditaliofix tran- 
scribed, and to let her have the 
original, as it waa all of her dear 
daughter's hand-writing; and as 
it might, when she could bear to 
look into it, adminiater consolation 
to herself. And that she had like- 
wise reserved for herself her pic-

oeent creatures, who may be 
drawn id bj your wicked arts and 
periurieB. You have not, in my 
wiailieB for your future welfare, 
the wiabea of a suppliant wife, 
endeavouring for hev ovm sake, as 
-well as for yours, to induce yon to 
reform those ways. They are 
wholly as disinterested as nnds- 
serred. But 1 should mistrust my 
own penitence, were 1 capable of 
wishing to recompense evil for 
evil — if, black as your offences 
have been against me, I could not 
forgive, as 1 wish to be forgiven. 

I repeat, therefore, that 1 do 
forgive Ton. And may the Al- 
mighty forgive you too! Nor have 
l,atttiewrit)Dgof this, any other 
essential reerets than what are 
occasioned by the grief I have 
given to parents , who , till 1 knew 
you, were the most indulgent of 
I parents', by the scandal given to 
the other branches of my family ; 
' by the disreputation brought upon 
^ nysex; and by the offence given 
I to virtue in my fall. 
' Ah to myself, you have only 
robbed me of what once were 
my favourite eipectations in the 
transient life I shall have quitted 
when you receive this. You have 
only been the cause that 1 have 
. beencutoffin thebloomofyouth, 
Land of cartailing a life, that might

say, that, in all probability, every 
hour I had lived with him might 
have brought with it some new 
trouble. AndIam(indeedthrough 
sharp afflictions and distresses) 
indebted to you, secondarily, as I 
humbly presume to hope, for so 
many years of glory, as might 
have proved years of danger, 
temptation, and anguish, had £ey 
been added to my mortal life. 

So, til, though no thanks to 
your inlerttioii , you have done me 
realservke; and in return, Iwish 
you happv. But such has been 
your life hitherto, that you can 
have no time to lose in setting 
about your repentance, Eepent- 
atice to such as have lived only 
carelessly, and in the omission of 
their re^lar duties, and who 
□ever aimed to draw auy poor 
creatures into evil , is not so easy 
a task, nor so much in our own 
power, as some imagine. How 
difBcult a grace tlien to be ob- 
tained, where the guilt is preme- 
ditated, wilful, and complicated! 

To say I once respected you 
with a preference, is what I ought 
to blush to own , since, at the very

LETTER CLI, 
r. LoicUcc to John BelFoiil , Esq. 

WHITE to demand back ag^n 
my last letter. I own it was my 
mind ftt the different times I wrote 
it; and whatever ailed me, I could 
not help writing it. Suchagloomy 
impnlBe eame upon me, and iu- 
creased as I wrote, that, for my 
Boul, I could not forbear running 
Into the miserable. 

'Tis atrange, very strange, that 
_ man's conscience should De able 
to force his fingers to write whe- 
ther he will or not ; and to run him 
into a subject he more than once, 
at the rery time, resolved not to 
think of. 

Nor is it less strange, that (no 
jOew reason occurring) be should 

>A d(V or two more, so totally 



change bis mind; have his miud, 
1 should rather say, so wholly il- 
lumiuatcd hygayliopes and nsIsK 
prospects, as to be ashamed en 
what he had written. 

For, on re-perusal of a copy of 
myletter, which fell into my hands 
by accident, in the hand-writing 
ofmy cousin Oh art otte , who, un- 
known to me , had trauacribed it, 
1 find it to be such a letter, as an 
enemy would rej oiee to see. 

This 1 know, that were I to have 
continued but one week more in 
the way 1 was in when I wrote the 
latter part of it, I should bare 
beencunflued, and in straw, Uie 
□eit : for I now recollect , that all 
my distemper was returning upon 
me with irresistible violence — 
and that iu spite of water-grnd 
and soupe-maigre. 

1 own,thatl am still exceseiveW 
grieved at the disappointment this 
admirable woman made it so 
much herwhimsical choice to give 
me. But , since it has thus f^en 
out; since she was determined to 
leave the world; and since ahe 
actually ceases lo be; ought I, who 
have such a share of life and 
health in hand, to indulge gloomy 
reflectioaB upon an event that is 

Eaaeed: and, (einq passed, cannot 
e recalled? — Have I not bad

abhor my former ways, I will read 
some of thine and copies of my 
own. 

The consequence of all this will 
be, that I shall be the delight of 
my own relations of both sexes, 
who were wont to look upon me as 
a lost man. I shall have good 
order in my own family, because 
I shall give a good example my- 
self I shall be visited and re- 
spected, not perhaps by Lovelace, 
by Mowbray, and by Tourville, 
because they cannot see me upon 
the old terms, and will not, per- 
haps, see me upon the new, but by 
the best and worthiest gentlemen, 
clergy as well as laity , all around 
me. I shall look upon my past 
follies with contempt; upon my 
old companions with pity. Oaths 
and curses shall be for ever ba- 
nished from my mouth : in their 
place shall succeed conversation

that power.

verily think, I should not have 
been guilty.

admirable woman. Let me now,

you: for I am afraid, very much 
afraid , that such is the enormity 
of this single wickedness, in de- 
priving the world of such a shining 
light , that if you do not quickly 
reform, it will be out of your 
power to reform at all ; and that 
rrovidence, which has already 
given you the fates of your agents 
Sinclair and Tomlinson , to take 
warning by, will not let the princi- 
pal offender escape, if he slight 
the warning. 

You will , perhaps , laugh at me 
for these serious reflections. Do, 
if you will. I had rather you 
should laugh at me for continwng 
in this way of thinking and acting, 
than triumph over me, as you 
threaten, on my swerving from 
purposes I have determined upon 
with such sood reason, and in- 
duced and warned by such 
examples. 

And so much for this subject at 
present. 

I should be glad to know when 
you intend to set out. I have too 
much concern for your welfare, 
not to wish you in a thinner air, 
and more certain climate.

That's the horrid thing; a man 
cannot begin to Hank, but cataes

the gloomy takes place, and mirth 
and gaiety abandon his heart for 

Poor M'Donald ! — I am rpally

useful, faithful, solemn varlet, 
who could act incomparably any 
part givenbim, and knennutwhat. 
a. blush was. — He really took ■ 
honest pains for me in the last 
affair; which has cost him and me 
BO dearly in reflection. Often 
gravelled, as we both were, yet 
was he never daunted. Poor 
M'Donald , I must once more say ! 
— For cairyiuE on a solemn piece 
ofroguery, hehadnoequal. 

I was BO solicitous to know if he 
were really as bad as thou bast a 
knack of painting every body 
whom thou singlest out toexereiso 
thy murdering pen upon, that I 
dispatched a man and horse to 
Maidstone, as soon as I had thine ; 
and had word brought me, that he 
died in two hours after he had 
received thy five guineas. And 
all thou wrotest of his concern in 
relation to the ever-dear Miss Har- 
lowe, it seems, was true. 

I can't help it, Belford! — I 
have only to add , that it is happy 
that the poor fellow lived not to 
be hanged, as it seems he would 
have been: for who knows, as he 
had got into such a penitential 
strain, what might have been in 
hisdying speech?

LETTER CLV. 
Mr. Lovelace to John Belford, Esq. 

But what a pretty scheme of 
life hast thou drawn out for thy- 
self, and thy old widow! \^y my 



BDtil, Jack, I am mightily taken 
with it. There is but one thing 
wanting in it; tiiid that will come 
of course: only to be in the com- 
mission, and one of the quorum. 
Thou art already provided with a 
clerk, as good asthou'lt waut, in 
the widow Lovick; for thon un- 
derstandest law, and she con- 
icience: a good lord chancellor 
ji^etween ye I — I should take pro- 
CrdieiouEi pleasure to hear thee de- 
I in a bastard case upon thy 
notions, ajid old remem- 



, .Airsoflevityl) if, after all, thou 
canst so easily repent and reform, 
»thoathinkestthoucanst:if thou 



master will bo readily dit 
tried and so faithful a servant, and 
permit thee thus calmly to enjoy 
thy new system; no room for 
Bcandal; all temptation ceasing; 
and if at last (thy reformation 
warranted and approved by time) 
ttioamarriesC, and livest honest: 
— whvBelford, I cannot but say, 
that if all these IF's come to pass, 
thou standest a good chance to be 
a happy man ! 

All I think , as I told thee in m^ 

last, is, that the devil knows his 

own iatereat too well, to let thee 

off so easily. Thou thyself tellest 

me, that we caimot repent when 

I ire will. And indeed 1 found it 

b^BO: for, in my lucid intervals, 1 

Kmade good resolutions; but, as 

Kjtealth turned its blythe side to 



390 

me, and opened my ptospecta of 
recovery, all my old inclinatioiiE 
and appetites returned; and this 
letter, perhaps, will be a thorough 
conviction to thee, that I aia as 
wild a fellow us ever, or iu the 
way to be BO. 

Thou askcat me very seriously, 
if, upon the faint sketcli thou hast 
drawn , thy new scheme be not in- 
finitely preferable to any of those 
which we have so long pursued? 
— Why, Jack — let me reflect — 
why, Belford — I can't say ^I 
can't say — but it is. To speak 
out — it is really , as Biddy iu the 
play Bays, a good comfortable 
scheme. 

But when thou telleat me , that 
it was thy misfortune to love me, 
because thy value for me made 
thee a wickeder man than other- 
wise thou would'st have been; I 
desire thee to revolve this asser- 
tiou: and I am persuaded, that 
thou wilt not find thyself in bo 
right a train as thou imaginest. 

Nofalse colourings, noglo&Bes, 
does a b'ue penitent aim at. De- 
basement, diflidence , mortifica- 
tion, contrition, are all near of kin, 
Jack; and inseparablo from a re- 
pentant spirit. — If thouknowest 
not this, thou art not got three 
steps (out of threescore) towards 
repentanceandamendment. And, 
let me remind thee, before the 
grand accuser come to do it, that 
tliou wert ever above being a pas- 
sive follower in iniquity, Thoogh 
thonhadst not so good an inven- 
tion as he to whom thou writest, 
thou hadst tu active an. luMi^ts»

mischief as ever I met with in 
man. 

Then for improving an hint, 
thou wert always a true English- 
man. I never started a roguery, 
that did not come out of thy forge 
in a manner ready anvilled and 
hammered for execution, when I 
have sometimes been at a loss to 
make any thing of it myself. 

What indeed made me appear 



saved the lady from the ruin she 
met with. Thou art a pretty fel- 
low for this ; for kow would*st thou 
have saved her? What methods 
didst thou icike to save her? 

Thou knewest my designs all 
along. Hadst thou a mind to 
make thyself a good title to the 
merit to which thou now pretend- 
est to lay claim, thou should'st, 
like a true knight -errant, have 



to be morewicked than thou, was, I sought to set the lady free 



that I being an handsome fellow, 
and thou an ugly one, when we 
had started a game , and hunted 



from the enchanted castle. Thou 
should'st have apprised her of her 
danger ; have stolen in when the 



it down , the poor frighted puss ; siant was out of the way: or hadst 
generally threw herself into my thou had the true spirit oichivaby 
paws, rather than into thine: and j upon thee, and nothing else would 
then, disappointed, hast thou have done, have killed the giant; 
wiped thy blubber -lips, and and then something would'st thou

calling me a wicked fellow all the ; *' O but thegiant was myfineud: 
while. I he reposed a confidence in me: 

In short, Belford, thou wert an and I should have betrayed m^ 
excellent starter and setter. The friend, and his confidence!** This 
old women were not afraid for thou would*st have pleaded, no 
their daughters, when they saw doubt But try this plea upon 
such a face as thine. But, when thy present principles, and tnoa 
/ came , whip was the key turned wilt see what a caitiff thou wert to 
upon the girls. And yet all signi- let it have weight with thee, upon 
fied nothing ; for love , upon oc- an occasion where a breach of 
casion, wia draw an elephant confidence is more excusable than 
through a key>hole. But for thy to keep the secret Did not the 
HKART, Belfbra, who ever doubted lady herself once put this veiy

sticks most upon me, which my blame thyself ^? 
conscience makes such a handle Thou canst not pretend, and I 
of a^nst me, art thou so innocent know thou wilt not, Uiat thou wert 
as thou fanciest thyself. Thou afraid of thy life by talcing audi ft 
wilt staure at this: fiut it is true, measure: for a braver fellow Irres 
aiui 1 will convince thee of it in not nor a more fearless, than Jack

stances, and thou canat uot forget 
them, where thou liast ventured 
thj bones, thy neck, tb; life, 
Bigainst numbers in a, cause ot 
roguery ; and hailst thou had a 
spark of that virtue, whieh now 
thou art willing to flatter thyaelf 
thou hast, thou would'at surely 
have run a risk to save an in- 
nocence, and a virtue that it he- 
came every man to protect and 
espouse, Thia is the truth of the 
case, greatly as it makes against 
myself But I hate an hypocrite 
from my soul. 

I believe I should have killed 
thee at the ^wii', if Icould, hadst 
lliou betrayed lue thus. But 1 am 
surenoHT.thatI would have thank- 
ed thee for it, with all mj heart ; 
and thought thee more a father, 
and a frieud, than my real father, 
aud my best friend — and it was 
natural for thee to think , with bo 
eitalted a merit as this lady had, 
that this would have been the 
ease, when consideration took 
place of passion : or, rather, when 
that d— ned fondness for in- 
trigue ceased, whieh never was my 
pride BO much as it is now, upon 
reflection, my curse. 

Set about defending thyself, 
and 1 will prohe thee still deeper, 
!t»d convict thee still mori> effec- 
tually, that thou bast more guilt 
than merit even in this affair. And 
as to all the others, in which we 
were accnatomed to hunt in 
couples, thou wert always the for- 
vrardest whelp, and more ready by 
far, to run away with me, tbanl 
with thee. Yet canst thou now 
compote thy hone-mUBclcs, and 



401 

cry out. How much more hast 
thou, Lovelace, to answer for than 
1 have ! — Saying nothing, neither, 
when thou sayest this, were it 
frue: for thoQ wilt not be tried, 
when the time cornea, by cinapari- 
xim. In short thou ma^ 'at, at this 
rate, so miserably deceive thyself, 
that notwithstanding all thy self- 
denial and mortification, when 
thou closest thy eyes, thou may's! 
perhaps open them in a place 
where thou thoughtest least to 
he. 

However, consult thy old 
woman on this subject. Isnallbe 
thought to be out of character if I 
go ou in this strain. But really as 
to a title to merit in thia affair, I 
do assure thee. Jack, that thou 
less deservest praise than an 
horse-pond; and I wish I had the 
mousing of thee. 

1 AM actually now employed in 
taking leave of my friends in the 
country. I had once thought of 
taking To ml inson, as I called him, 
with me; but his destiny has 
frustrated that intention. 

Next Monday I think to see you 
intowni and then you, and I, and 
Mowbray and Tourville, will 
laugh otF that evening together. 
They will both accompany me (as 
I expect jiiK will) toDojrer, if not 
cross the water. I must leave you 
and them good friends. They 
take extremely amiss the treat- 
ment you have given them in your 
lastlettora. They say you strike 
at theh- understandings. I laugh 
at them; and tell them, tiiat those

■'soke, that he etves him, with so 
lodicrous anif unconcerned an 
~ ', such solemn and useful les- 
18 and warnings. Neverthe- 
B, he resolTOa to make it his 
lOle endeavour, he tells him, 
"to render them efficacioua to

^ self but too happy, if he should 
be enabled to bgI him such " 
example, as may be a means 
bring abont the refonnation of 
a man bo dear to him as he haa 
^'always been, from the firet of 
piheiraaiuaintance; and who is 

Sable of thinking so rightly 
deeply; thoagn at present 
ktoanchUttie purpose, as makes 
' ' very knowledge 




subject that 1 must not, cannot 
diBpense with; as I promiBed the 
divine lady, that 1 would do every 



thing in my power to prevent that 
fiirthermischief of winch she was 
BO very apprehensive. 

I will not content myself with 
distant hints. It Ib with very great 
concern that I have just now 
heard of a declaration which you 
are aaid to have made to your re- 
lations at Harlowe Place, that 
you wilt not rest till you have 
avenged your couain's wrongs 
upon Mr, Lovelace. 

Far he it from me to offer to de- 
fend the unhappy roan, or even 
\indulyta extenuate his crime 1 But 
yet I must say, that the family, by 
theirperaecutions of the dear lady 
at first, and by their implacable- 
noss afterwards, ought, at least, 
to slutre the blame with him. 
There is even gi'Cat reason to be- 
lieve, that a lady of such a reli- 
giouB turn, her virtue neither to 
be florprised nor corrupted, her 
will inviolate, would have got over 
atneie perxdiKii injury ; eapecially 
as ho would have done all thatwat 
in his power to repair it; and as, 
from the application of all his fa- 
mily in hia favour , and other cir- 
cumstances attending his sincere 
and voluntary offer, the lady 
might have condescended, with 
greaterglory to herself, than if he 
id never offended. 
When 1 have the pleasure of 
se^g you next, I will acquaint 
-ou,air, with all thooiroumatances 
f this melancholy atory; from 
liich you will see, that tar, Love- 
lace was extremely ill treated at 
first by the wholefamily, thiaad- 
mirable lady excepted. This ex- 
ception, I know, lv«\^VsD&>a>k

crime : but us his principal ijiteu- 
tion was but to try her virtue ; and 
that he became so earnest a sup- 
pliant to her for tnarria^; and as 
he lias suffered bo deplorably in 
the loss of hia reason, for not 
having it in his poiver to repair her 
wrongs; I presume to hope, that 
much is to be pleaded against 
such a resolution as tou are said 
to hare made. I will read to you 
at the same time some pafsa^es 
liom letters of his; two of which 
(one but this moment received) 
will convince you, that the un- 
happy man. Who is but now re- 
covering his intellects, needs no 
greater punishment than what he 
has from his own reilectione. 

I have just now read ove 
copies of the dear lady's post- 
humous letters. I send them all 
to you, except that direeted foi 
Mr. Lovelace, which I reserve till 
I have the pleasure of seeing you. 
Lot me entreat you to reaa once 
more Ihat written to yourself, and 
Mdltoher brother*; which latter 
I now send you; as they are in

larly for your present kind inter- l

Almighty for ever bless you, dear 
sir, for the kindness you endea- 
voured to procure for me ! 

One principal end of my writing 
to you in thia solemn manner, is, 
to beg of you, which I do with the 
utmost earnestness, thatwhenyou 
come to hear the particulara ofmy 
story, you will not suffer aclice 
resentment to take place in your 
generous breaat on my account. 

Kemember, my dear cousin, 
that vengeance ia God's province, 
and he has undertaken to repay 
it; nor will you, I hope, iuvadle 
that province: — especially as 
there ia no neceaaity for you to 
attempt to vindicate my fame; 
since the offender himself (before 
he is called upon) lias stood forth, 
and offered to do me all thejustice 
that you could have e^itorted from 
him, had Hived: and when your 
own person may be endangered 
by running an equal liuk with a 
gui/ti/ man. 

Duelling, sir, I need not tell 
yov, who nave adorned a public 
character, is not only an usorna- 
tion of the divine prerogative, but 
it ia an insult upon magistracy 
and good government. "Tis an 
impious act. 'Tia an attempt to 
take away a life that ought not to 
depend uponaprivate sword: an 
act, the consequence of which is 
to huriT a soul (all its sins upon 
its head) into peraition; endanger-

SeeK not then, I beaeech you, 
sir, to aggravate my fault, by a

of that fault. Give not the u 
happy man the merit (were y( 
assuredly to he the victor) of fal

is the perfidious, the ungrateful 
deceiver; but will not the forfei- 
ture of uis life , and the probable 
loss of his soul , be a dreadful 
piation forhavingmadememii 
able for a few months only, and 
through that misery, by the divine 
favour, happy to all eternity? 

In such acafle,inycouBiii,wherfi

avenge on youV — And who 
your avenger? 

Let the poor man's conscien

will one day find pimishment 
more than enough from that. 
liSave him to the chance of re- 
pentance. If the Almighty will 
give him time for it, why should 
you deny it him ? — Let him still 
be the guilty aggreasor; and Ie1 
no one say, Clarissa Harlowe it 
now amply revenged in his fall; 
or, in the case of yours, (which 
Heaveu avert!) that her fault, 
instead of being buried in her 
grave, is perpetuated, and ag- 
gravated,, by a loss far greater 
flianthat of herself.

give you 

I Rm obliged to you for tbe let- 
ten you have communicaited to 
me; and stiLftirther for your pro- 
mise to favour me with others oc- 
casionally. 

All that relates to my dear 
coUBinlahall beglad tosee, beit 
from whom it will. 

I leave to your own discretion, 
what may or may not be proper 
for Miss Howe to see from a pen 

I admire her Bpirit. Were she a 
man , do you think , sir , she at this 
iiiiie would have your advice Jo 
take, upon BuchaHuhJectas that 
upon which you write? 

Pear not, however, that your 
communications shall put ueupon 
any meaauies that otherwise I 
should not have taken. The wick- 
edness, sir, is of such a nature, as 
admits not of aggravation. 

Tet I do assure you, that I have 
not made any resolutions that will 
beatieu^ionuie. 

I have indeed expreased myself 
with vehemence upon the occa- 
sion. Who could forbear to do so? 
But it is not my way to resolve iu 
matters of moment, till oppor- 
tunity brings the execution of my 
purposes within my reach. We 
shall see by what manner of spirit 
this young man will be actuated, 
on his recovery. If he continue to 
brave and defy R family, which he 



407 

has so irreparably iiyuved — if ^ 
but resolutions ilepeodinK upon 
future contingencies are best left 
to future determination, asljnat 
now hinted. 

Meantime, I will own, that I 
think my cousin's arguments un- 
answerable. No go'ifi man but 
must be influenced by them. — 
But, alas! sir, who u good? 

As to your arguments ; I hope 
you will believe ine, when I as- 
sure you, as I now do, tbat^our 
opinion , and your reasonmga, 
have, and will always have , great 
and deserved weight withme: and 
that I respect you still more thanl 
did, if possible, for your eipostu- 
latious in support of my cousin's 
pious injunctions to me. They 
come from yoa, air, with the great- 
est propriety, as her executor and 
representative; and likewise as 
you are a man of humanity, and a 
well-wisher to both parties. 

I am not exempt from violent 

eissions,sir, any more than your 
iend; but then I hope they are 
only capable of being raised by 
other people's insolence, and not 
by vay own arrogance. If ever I 
iun stimulated by my imperfec- 
tions and my resentment to act 
against m^ judgment, and my 
cousin's injunctions; some such 
reflections as these that follow, 
will run away with my reason. 
Indeed they are always present

Then I reflect, too-too often per-

miaerabie for their lives? 

That the more faulty her friends 
were as to her, the more enorm- 
uua his ingratitude, and tbc 
more inexcusable — what! sir, 
wns it not enough, that sbe 
EufFered what she did for hint, 
but the barbarian must make 
her suffer for her sufferings for 
hU eakef — Passion makes me 
express this weakly: passion 
refuses the aid of expression 
sometimes, where the propriety 
of a resentment, /iranu/aei'e, de- 
clares expression to be needless. 
I leave it to yvu, air, to give this 
reflection its due force. 

That the author of this diffusive 
mischief perpetrated it pre- 
meditatedly, waotoulv, in the 
gaiety of his heart. To try my 
cousin, sayyoUj sir! To try the 
virtue of a Clarissa, sir! — Had

Miss Howe of this; aud she ia as

done, as if she had been the pur-

she could only have wished to 
purchase these because they were 
her beloved friend's, — Thegrand-

and the money will be paid me for

FrlendAip, generally speaking, 
Mr. Belford, is too fervent a flame 
for female miude to manace: a 
light,that batinafewoftheirhands 
bums steady , and often hnrriea 
the sei into tligbt &nd absurd!^. 
Like other eitremea, it is hardly 
ever durable. Marriage, whien 
is the highest state of friendeliip, 
generally absorbs the rooatvebe-, 
ment frieDdships of female to fe- 1 
male; and that whether thewed-| 
lock be happy 

Whatfemale mind is capable of 
two fervent friend ships at the 
same time? — This I mention as u 
general observaliim : but the friend- 
ship that Babsiated between these 
two ladies afibrds a remarkable 
exception to it; which I account 
for from those qualities s 
tiunments in hoih, nhich, 
they more common, would furnish 
more exceptions still in favour of 
thes( 

Both had aa^/arged, and even 
a lifieral, education; both had 
minds thirsting after virtuous 
knowledge: groat readers both 
great writers — [and eudi/ famillai 
ivrUing I take to bo oue of the 
irrOttUiit openers and improvers of 
^ inlnd, that -- 



llitflj [n fortune^ therefore above 
that dependence each on thr 
utjicr, that frequently destroyi 
till) familiarity which is the cement 
uf friondihip. Both eiceliine in 
■"" Til luojK, in which neither 
t to excel the other. Both 
' irilliclear and diatinguiBh- 



ing faculties; with solid scivw; 
and from their first intimaiCy [i 
' have many of jny lighU, sir, from 
Mrs. Norlonj each seeing some- 

' thing in the other to fear, a. -™ 

as to lore; yet making it a. ._ 
dispensable condition of tlieit 
friendship, each to tell the otba 
of her failings; and to be Aankfiil 
for the freedom taken. One bf 
nature gentle; the other madr iv 
by her Ince and admiraliin of bet 
eialtcd friend — impossible that 
there could be a friendship better 
calculated for duration. 

I must, however, take the liber^ 
to blame Miss Howe for her be< 
haviour to Mr. Hickman. And! 
infer from it, that even women ol 
senae are not to be trusted witk 

By the way, I am sure I n 
not desire you not to communi- 
cate to this fervent young lai^' 
the liberties 1 take with her ehii- 

I dare say, my cousin could not' 
approve ofMiss Howe's behaviour 
to this gentleman: a behaviour 
which is talked oi hii as many a 
knoio Mr. Hwktnan and her. Cann 
wise youag ladr be easy under 
Buchcensurc? SheTnuaf knowit 

Mr. Hickman is really a reef 
worthy man. Every body epeakf 
well of him. But he is gentle* 
disposition ed, and be adores W ' 
Howe; and love admits notof 
air of even due iVg^iily to the ob- 

J'ect of it. Yet will Mr. Hickman 
lardlyever get back the reins hft 
has yielded up; unless she, bf 
cftnying too far the power t**^ 
which ibe aeemi at presoit to 



Benstble, abould, when she has no 
'~ iurs to confer which he has not 

e' t to demand, provoke him 
ow off the too neavy yoke. 
And should he do so, and then 
treat her with negligeuce, Miss 
Hovm, of all the women I know, 
vrill be the least able to support 
berself andor it. She will then be 
Mord unhappy than she ever made 
iim; for a, man who is imeaay at 
home, can divert bimaclf abroad: 
trtiich a woman cannot so easily 
.do without scandal. — Permit me 
to take further notice as to Miss 
Sowe ; that it is very obvious to 
me, that she has, by her haughty 
<bebaviour to this worthy man, iti~ 
Tolved herself in one difficult 
-ftom which she knows not how to 
teitricate herself with that grace 
1 which accompanies all her actions. 
She inteuda to have Mr. Hickman. 
I believe she does not dislike him. 
And it will cost her no small pains 
to descend from the elevation to 
which she has climbed. 

Another inconvenience she will 
Buffer from her having taught 
every body (for she is above dis- 
guise) to think, by her treatment 
of Mr. Hickman, mvch more meanli/ 



^iuinour iu his dishonour? 

Mrs. Hone is much disturbed at, 
ber danghter's bebaviour to the 
gentleman. Ueis very deservedly 
a favourite of hera. But [another, 
failing in Mies Howe] ber mother 
has not all the authoritv with her 
that a mother ought to have. Miss 
Howe is indeed a womau of line 
eenae; but it requires a high de- 



gree of good understanding, 
well as a sweet and gentle dispo- 
sition of mind, and great discre- 
tion, in a child, when grown iij 
to let it be seen that she miugli 
reuerence with ber hoe, to a pi. 
rent, who has talents visibly infe- 

Mias Howe ia open, genernui, 
nobte. The mother has not any of 
her fine qualities. Parents, in 
order to preserve their children's 
veneration for them, should take 
great care not to let them see any 
thing in their conduct, or be- 
haviour, or principlos, which they 
themselves would not approve of 
in others. 

Mr. Hickman has, however, 
this consideration to comfort him- 
self with, that the same vivacity 
S which he suffers, makes Miss 
pwe's own mulher, at times, 
eqvallg sensible. And as he sees 
enough of this beforehand, he will 
have more reason to blame him- 
self than the lady, should she 
prove as lively a wife, as she was 
a mistress, for having continued 
his addresses, and married her, 
against such threatening ap- 
pparauces. 

There is also another circum- 
stance, which good-natured men 
who engage with even lively 
women, may look forward to with 
pleasure; a circumstance which 
generally lowers the spirits of the 
Isdies, and danteslicates them, as I 
may call it: and which, as it will 
bring those of Mr. Hickman and 
Miss Howe nearer to a par, that 
worthy gmtleman «iU.hBN«&miA»

reason, when it happe: 
grutulate himself upon. 

Bat after all, I see that there ia 
something so chiU'Tniitgly hrilliant 
and frank in Miss Howe b disposi- 
tion, althongh, at [irosent, visibly 
overclouded by grief, that it is 
impossible not to love her, even 
fur her failings. She may, and 
I hope she will, make Mr. Hick- 
man an obliging wife; and if ehe 
does, she will have additional 
merit with me; since she cannot 
be apprehensive of check or con- 
troui; and may therefore by her 
generositg and pnidence lay an 
obligation upon her husband, by 
the performance of what is no 
more than her dull/. 

Her mother both lnves and fearti 
her. Yet is Mrs. Hone also a 
woman of vivacity, and ready

when she ^ . 

she has, as I hinted above, ueo^'cn- 

edher authority by the 

of her mind. 

Yet once she praised her daugh- 
ter to mo with BO much warmlhtoi 
the generosity of her spirit, that 
had I not known the .old lady's 
character, I should have thought 
her generous liersdf. And yet I 
have always observed thatpcople, 
even of narrow tempera, are ready 
to praise geuerons onea: — and 
(ftujhave laeconnted for it; that 



The old lady applied herself to 
ne, to urge to the young one the 
ntenta of the frill, in ordei to 



hasten her to fix a day for her 
marriage: but de.iired that ] 
would not let Miss Howe knoil 
that she did. 

I took the liberty upon it to tefl 
Miss Howe, that I hoped that hef 
part of a will, i 
punctually, in aln 
articles, fulfiUed, 
the only one that wonid 
slighted. 

Her answer was, she would con- 
sider of it; and made 
tesy with such an air, as shewed 
me, that she thought me more on' 
of my sphere, than I conld alloi 
her to think me, had I been per- 
mitted to argue the point t'-"" 
her. 

I foimd MJBS Howe and her { 
servant maid in deep moumi ^ 
This, it seemB, had occasioned k 
great debate at first between ho 
mother and her. Her mother IimI 
the words of the will on her aid^ 
and Mr. Hickman's interest inhei 
view; her daughter havine ettidi 
that she would wear -* *— 
six months at least. Bi.._ ..._ 
young lady carried her poiiit — ' 
"Strange, said she, "if I, wlia 
shall mourn the heavy, the ii»- 
parable loss to the last hour oimf- 
life, should not shew mjoancfflll 
to the world for a few montliB!" 

Mr. Hickman, for his part, w 
so far from uttering an opjHMing 
word on this occasion, thatontha 
veiy day that Mias Howe put 0» 
her.i, he waited on her in A now 
suit of mourning, as for a near ttt' 
laKon. Hia servants and eqnP 
page made the same respeetfOl 
.a^eanmee. 



Whether tlie mother wascou-, 
Hulted by him iu it, I cannot say: 
tnittho daughter knew nothing of i

tX him with surprise, and asked 
I him, for whom he monmed ? I

[Urn, Sal. Sept. 30. 

I LiTTLB thought I ever could 
have owed ao much obligation t« 
aay man, aa you have laid me 
under. Anil yet what you have 
iteat me has almost broken my 
heart, and ruined my eyes. 

I am Burpriscd, though agree- 
ably, tbat you have bo eoou and 
so well got over that part of the 
tnistyou have engaged in, which 
relates to the family. 

It may be presumed, from the 
exits you mention of two of the 
iufemal man's accomplices, that 
the thunderbolt will not stop 
short of the principal. Indeed 1 
have some pleasure to think it 
soems rolling along towards the 
devoted head that has plotted ajl 
the mischief. But let me, how- 
ever, say, that although 1 think 
Mr. Mordcn not altogether in the 
wrong in hia reasons for reaent- 
ment, as he is the dear creature's 
kinsman and trustee; yet I think 
you very much in the right in 
endeavouring to disauade him 
from it. as you are her OKecutor, 
and act iu pursuance of her 
earnest request. 

But what a letter is that of the 
infernal man I I cannot observe 
upon it. Neither caul, for very 
different reasons, upon my dear 
creature's posthumous letters : 



pei'fections died, when my Clarissa 
drew her last breath! 
If decency be observed in hia 



letters; for I have not yet hod 
patience to read above two or 
three of them {besides this horrid 
one, which I return you inclosed); 
I may some time heace be curious 
to look, by llieir means, into the 
heartsof wretches, which, though 
Uioy must be the abhorrence of 
virtnouB minds, will, when laid 
open , (aa 1 presume they are in 
them) SkSoid a, prap^r foaming to 
those who read them , and teach 
them to detest men of such pro- 
fligate cliaracters. 

If your reformation be aincere, 
you will not be offended that I do

a criterion to try yourself by. 

By this letter of the wicked 
man it is apparent , that there are 
still wickeder women. But see 
what a guilty commerce with the 
devila of your sex will bring those 
to, whoaemoralsyehaveruined! 

— For those women were once

them otherwise. The first bad

worse men: those upon still 
worse; till they commenced de- 
vils incarnate — the height of 
mickednena or ofuhwiie, is mil ar-

ran into the error oF those , who, 
wanting to be thought above 
hypocrisy and flattery , fall into 
rOBticitj, if not ill manners; a 
common fault with such, who, 
iiot caring to correct conBtilu- 
tional failmgs , aeek to gloas them 
over by some nomiViui virtue; 
when afl the time , perhaps , these 
failings are entirely owing to 
native arrogance ; or , at least , to 
a contracted rust, that they will

and, by what 1 am going to write, 
you will iiad me still more free: 
and yet I am aware, that such of 
my sex as will not assume some 
little dignity, and exact respect 
from yours, will render themselves 
cheap; and perhapH, for their 
modesty and diffidence , be repaid 
with scorn and insult. 

Ent the scorn I will endeavour 
not to deserve; and the insult 1 
will not benr.

fession of more than it imports ; to 
wit, "That I am haughty, un-

Ounk I aught la marry at all! 

If I marry either a sordid or im-

Long did I stand out against 
all the offers made me, and against 
all the pcrsnaaions of my mother; 
and, to tell you the truth, the 
longer, and with the mare ob- 
stinacy, as the person my choice 
would have first fallen upon, nas 
neither approved by my mother, 
nor by my dear friend. This 
rivetted me to my pride , and to 
my opposition; for a! though I was 
convmced, after awhile, that my 
choice would neither have been 
prudent or happy; and that the 
specious wretch was not what he 
had made mc believe he was; yet 
could I not easily think of any 
other man: and indeed, from the 
detection of liiin, took a settled 
Hversioii to the whole sex.

LETTER CLXV. 



Lundon, Tuesday nighl, Ool. 3. 

I OBGi your lordship's commands 
with great pleasure. 

Yesterday in the afternoon Mr. 
Lovelace made me a visit at my 
lodgings. As I woa in expectation 
of one from Colonel Morden abont 
the same time, 1 thought proper 
to carry him to a tavern which 
neitherof us frequented, (on pre- 
tence of an half- appointment) 
ordering notice to be sent me 
thither, if the colonel came: and 
Mr. Lovelace sent to Mowbray! 
and Touryille , and Mr. Doleman,

our three old coiripamons , audfti 
nephew of Mr. Doleman's (whoT 
had a good while been desirous to 
pass an hour with Mr. Lovelace) 
it blew ofl' for the present. J 

Mr, Mowbray and Mr. Tonrville 
had also taken some exceptions "^ 
the freedom of iny_pen; aud 1 
Lovelace, after his way, tod 
upon him to reconcile us ; and " 
it at the expense of all three j : 
with such an infinite run of bumoin 
andraillery, that we had nothiiu 
to do but to laugb at what be saio 
and at one another. I can deil 
tolerably with him at my pen ; l. _ 
is conversation he has no equftt 
In short, it was his day. He w — 
glad, he said, to find himu 
alive; and his two friends, clu 
ping and rubbins their haua 
twenty times in an hour, declared 
that now once more he was sJI 
himself; thecharming'st feUowin 
the world; aud they would folloll 
him to the farthest part of t*""

' gay hour, imnnnmun. We 

EwBtch every turn of such a. one's 

Baountenance , and arereBolvedto

lifceuttcTB what we are expecting to 

ESon from his lips. 

■• Mr. Doleman and his nephew 

I'took leave of us by twelve. Mnw- 

M'iiiiLji and Tourville grew very 

V'BOisy by one : and were carried on 

by two. Wme never moves Mr. 

Lovelace, not with standing a vi. 

vacity which generally hSpa on 

over-gay spirita. As to myself, 

the little part I had taken in their 

gaiety, kept me unconcerned. 

The clock struck three before 
could get him into any serioua o 
attentive way — bo natural to him 
ia gaiety of heart; and such strong 
hold had the liveliuess of the even 
ing taken of him. His conversa' 
tion, you know, my lord, when 
his heart is free, runs off to the 
bottom without any dregs. 

But after that hour, and when 
weUiought of parting, he became 
a little more serious: and then he 
told me his designs, and gave 
aplanof his intended tour; wish- 
ing heartily, that I could have 
accompanied him. 

We parted about four; he not 
a, little dissntiEfied with me; for 
we had some talk about subjects, 
which, he said, he loved not tc 
think of; to wit. Miss Harlowe'f 
will; my eiecntorship; papers 1 
had in confidence communicated

1 etters he had written to me ^ from 
the time that he had made his first 
addresses to her. 

again , he 
eaid; and it would be upon veiy 
ill terms if I complied not with bis 
request Which 1 bid him not 
expect. But, that I might not 
deny him every thing, I told him, 
that I would give bim a copy of 
the will; though I was sure, I 
said, when ho read it, he would 
wish he had never seen it. 

I had ft message from him about 
eleven this morning, desiring me 
to name a place at which to dino 
with him, and Mowbray, and 
Tourville, for the last time; and 
anon after another from Colonel 
Murden, inviting me to pass the 
evening with him at the Bedford 
Head in Covent Garden. And, 
thatlmigbt keep them at distance 
from one another, I appointed 
Mr. Lovelace at the Eagle in Suf- 
folk Street. 

There I met him, and the two 
others. We began where we left 
olFat our last parting; and were 
vei7 high with each other. But, 
at Inst, all was made up, and he 
offered to forget and to forgive 
every thing, ou condition that I 
would correspond with him while 
abroad, and continue the series 
which had been broken through 
by his illness; and particularly 
give him, as I had offered, a copy 
of the lady's will. 

I promised him; and he then 
fell lo rallying me on my gravity, 
and on my tef<¥n&*!i.\sitt wSasssoafc^ii

as he called them. As we walked 
about the room , pipecting di 
to be brought in, be laid his hand 
npon m^ Bboulder; then pushed 
me from him with a curse : walking 
round me, and surveying itie from 
head to foot; then calling for tbc 
observation of the othei-s, he 
turned round upon bis heel, and 
with one of his peculiar wild airs, 
"Ha, ha, ba, bal" burst he out, 
" that these scur-1'aced proselytes 
should take it into their heads 
that they cannot be pious, with- 
out forfeiting both their good na- 
ture and good maunersl — Why, 
Jack," tiu:ning me about , "pr'y-

however, I told him not of,) : 
turned the scale ; and he agrea

Belford, thou hast a confounded 

1 parcel of briars and thorns to

know, if 1 think him the man be

balancing whether he 
should set out the next morning, 
' ir the morning after. But finding 
' ' lofbing to do, and Col. 



against him, he oaght to leavj 
the kingdom till he had thiowa 
himself in their way. 

Mowbray gave his opinion. tliH 
be ought to leave it like a man i 
honour as he was; and if he d 
not take those genClemen to taa 
for their opprobrious speeches 
that at least he should be seen bl 
tliein iu public before he w^ 
away; <lse theymightgive thnn- 
selves aire, as if he had \e& tb< 
kingdom in fear of them. 

1 o this he himself so mucli iiti 
clined, that it was with ditHcultyl 
p ersuaded him,that as they had oei- 
i.her of them proceeded to n direct 
aadformal challenge; as they knew 
he hud not made himself difficDtt 
of access ; and as he had already 
done the family injury enooghi, 
and it was Miss Harlowo's eankest 
desire, that he would be content 
with that; he had no reason, from: 
any point of honour, to delay hia 
journey; especially as he lijt4 ~~ 



S! 



just a motive for hin going, aatlie 
estabtiahingof his heutth; and fia 
he might return the aoouer, if he 
saw occasion for it. 

I found the colonel in a very 
■olemnwaj. We had a good de&l 
of ducourae upon the subject of 
certain letters nhieh had passed 
between us in relation to Miss 
'Harlowe's will , and to her family. 
'He has some accouuta to settle 

ithhis baoker; which, he aaya, 
..ill be adjusted to-morrow; and 
ioa Thursday he proposes to go 
dtyn again, to take leave of his 
friends; and then intends to set 
oat directly for Italy. 

I wish Mr. Lovelace could 
have been prevailed upon to take 
any other tour, than that of 
France and Italy. 1 did propose 
Madrid to him; but he lauL'hed at 
me, and told me, that the pro- 
posat was in character from a 
muk; and from one who was be- 

>me as grave aa a Spaniard of 

[6 old cut, at iimeiy. 

I expresaed to the. colonel mv 
apprehensions, that hia cOuaina 
^ing injunctions would not liave 
ne force upon him that wore to be 
wished. 

"They have gnat forrn upon 
me, Mr. Belford," said he: "or 
one iPorW would not have held Mr. 
Xiovelace and me thus long. But 
liny intention is to go to Florence ; 
'BOt to lay my houea there, aa upon

ship is not a stranger: for he said, 
every one who was dear to his be- 
loved cousin, must be so to him: 
and he knew that the gentleman 
whom he had thoughts of, would 
have, besides my advice and as- 
Bistanec, the adviceof oneof the 
most sensible ladies in England.] 

He took my hand, seeing me 
under some surprise: You must 
not hesitate, much less deny me, 



429 

Mr. Belford. Indeed you must 
not. Two things 1 will assure you 
of: thatlhave, aslhope, made 
every thing so clear that you can- 
not have any litigation: and that 
I have done BO justly, andl hope 
it will he thought so geaerously, 
hy all my relations, that a minil 
like yours will rather have plea- 
Btu'e than pain in the eseeution of 
this trust And this is what I 
think every honest man, who 
hopes to find an honest man for ' 
his executor, should do. 

1 told him, that I was greatly 
obliged to him for hia good opinion 
of ine : that it was so much every 
man's dull/ to be au honest man, 
that it could not be interpreted as 
vanity to say, that 1 had no doubt 
to be found so. But if I accepted 
of this trust, it must be on con- 
dition — 

I could name no condition, he 
saidf, interrupting me, which he 
would refuse to comply with. 

This condition, 1 told him, was, 
that as there was as great a pro- 
bability of bis being tny survivor, 
as I hia, be would permit me to 
name Mm for mine; and, in that 
case, a week should not pass be- 
fore 1 made my will. 

With all his heart, be said; and 
the readier, as ho had no ap- 



ed was really the effect of the 
tisfaction he had taken in the part 
I had already acted as his cousin's 
executor; and in my ability, he 
was pleased to add: as well as in 
jrarsuanee of his cousin's advice 
in the preaiiil>l«tftViBt^t*ii,Ms-*&-,

'^That this was a work which 
should be set about in full health, 
both of body and mind." 

I told him, that I was pleased to 
hear him say, that he was not in 
any apprehension of suddenly 
dyin^ ; as this gave me assurance 
that ne had laid aside all thoughts 
of actinj^ contrary to the dying re- 
quest of his beloved cousin. 

Does it argue, said he, smiling, 
that if I were to pursue a venge- 
ance so justifiable in my own 
opinion, I must be in apprehension 
of falling by Mr. Lovelace's hand ? 
— I will assure you, that I have no 
fears of that sort — but I know 
this is an ungrateful subject to 
you : Mr. Lovelace is your Mend ; 
and I will allow , that a good man 
may have a friendship for a lad 
one, so far as to wisn him well, 
without countenancing him in his 
evil. 

I will assure you, added he, that 
I have not yet made any resolu- 
tions either way. I have told you 
what force my cousin's repeated 
requests have with me. Hitherto 
they have withheld me — but let 
us quit this subject. 

This, sir, [giving me a sealed-up 
parcel] is my will. It is witnessed. 
I made no doubt of prevailing 
upon you to do me the requested 
favour. I have a duplicate to 
leave with the other gentleman; 
and an attested copy, which I 
shall deposit at my banker's. At 
my return , which will be in six or 
eight months at farthest, I will

You will soon hear of me again. 

He then very solemnty em- 
braced me, as I did him: and we 
parted. 

I heartily congratulate jour 
lordship on the narrow escape 
each gentleman has had from the 
other: for I apprehend, that they 
could not have met without fatal 
consequences. 

Time, I hope, which subdues all 
things, will subdue their resent- 
ments.

Several other letters passed between 
Miss Howe and Mr, Belford, re- 
lating to the disposition of the 
papers and letters; to the Poor's 
Fund; and to other articles of the 
lady's will: wherein the method of 
proceeding in each case was ad- 
justed. After which the papers 
were returned to Mr. Belford, that 
he might order the two directed co- 
pies of them to be taken. 

In one of these letters Mr. Belford 
requests Miss Howe to give the 
character of the friend she so 
dearly loved: "a task, he im- 
agines, that will be as agree- 
able to herself as worthy of her 
pen.

age, this admirable lady be- 
came mistress of such extra-

you will be able to collect from

Morden'a letters to you, particu- 
larly that of Sept. 23;** and from 
tbe letters of the detestable wretch 
himself, who, I find, hiie done her 
justice, although to his own con- 
demnation: all these together will 
enable i/ou, who seem to be f<o 
great au admirer of her virtues, to 
[•perform tbe task; and, I think,' 
HMtter than any person I know.

Etttlmake it my request, that if 
you do any thing in this way , you 
will let me see It. Iflfindituot 
to my mind, I will add ordiminish, 
as justice shall require. 

She was a wonderful creature 
from ber mfancf/; but I suppose 
you intend to give a character of 
her at those years when she was 
qualified to beau example toother 
young ladies, rather than a history 
of her life. 

I'erhapa, nevertheless, you will 
choose to give a description of her 
person: and aa you knew not the 
dear creature when ber heart was 
easy, Iwill tell you whatyet, in 
part, you can confirm ; 

That her shape was so fine , her 
proportiou ao exact, her featurea 
BO regular, ber complexion so 
lovely, and her whole person and 
mannersodistinguisbingly charm- 
ing, that she could not move with- 
out being admired and followed by 
the eyes of every one, though 
Htrangera, who never aaw her be- 
fore. Col. Morden's letter, above 
referred to, will confirm this. 

In ber dresa she was elegant be- 
yond imitation; and generally 
led the fashion to all ^e^Iadlea 
round her, without seeming to 
intend it, and without being proud 
of doing BO.* 

She was rather tall than of a 
middhng stature; and had a 
dignity in her aspect and air , that 
bespoke the mind that animated 
every feature.

appearance, to impute pride to j "In the general scale of beings, 
her. But these were such as knew I the lowest is as useful, and as much 
that they should have been proud a link of the great chain, as the 



of any one of her perfections: 
judging therefore by their own 
narrowness, they thought it im- 
possible that the lady who pos- 
sessed so many, should not think 
herself superior to them all. In- 
deed, I have heard her noble 
aspect found fault with , as indi- 
cating pride and superiority. But 
people awed and controlled, 
though butby their o wnconscious- 
ness of inferiority, will find fault, 
right or wrong, with those, of 
whose rectitude of mind and man- 
ners their own culpable hearts ^ive 
them to be afraid. But, in the bad 
sense of the word. Miss Clarissa 
Harlowe knew not what pride 
was. 

You may, if you touch upon this 
subject, throw in these sentences 
of hers , spoken at different times, 
and on different occasions. 

"Persons of accidental or 
shadowy merit, may be proud: 
but inborn worth must be always 
as much above conceit as arro- 
gance." 

**Who can be better, or more 
worthy, than they should be ? And, 
who shall be proud of talents they 
give not to themselves?" 

"The darkest and most con- 
temptible ignorance is that of not 
knowing one's self; and that all 
we have, and all we excel in, is the 
gift of God." 

"AJi human excellence is but 



comparative — there axo per^oivax^'^^si^^^^^'^^- 



highest." 

"The grace that makes every 
other grace amiable, is humqjtt. ' 

"There is but one pride pardon- 
able ; that of being above doing a 
base or dishonourable action.** 

Such were the sentiments by 
which this admirable young lady 
endeavoured to conduct herself, 
and to regulate her conduct to 
others. 

And in truth , never were affa- 
bility and complacency (gracma- 
ness, some have called it) more 
eminent in any person, man or 
woman, than in her, to those i^ 
put it in her power to oblige them: 
insomuch that the benefited has 
sometimes not known which to 
prefer; the grace bestowed, or the 
manner in which it was conferred. 

It has been observed, that what 
was said of Henry IV. of France, 
might be said of her manner of re- 
fusing a request; that she gener- 
ally sent from her presence the 
person refused, nearly as well 
satisfied as if she had nranted it 

Then she had such a sacred 
regard to truth — you cannot, sir, 
expatiate too much upon this 
topic. I dare say , that in all her 
letters , in all the letters of tiie 
wi'ctch , her veracity will not once 
be found impeachable, although 
her calamities were so heavy, toe 
horrid man's vriles so subtle, and 
her struggles to free herself from 



llcr cbiirity wis ao great, tbat 
ahe alimys chose to defciiil or

gave occasiou for it; and wlicn,

tended a ;/etieral reprehension,

appear arrogant or assuming to 
level more p-itper/i/] let me be Miss 
Fanny DarUugton. Then remov- 
ing out of the eirclc, and standing 
up, — Here I stand , unworthy oT

pany, till I have cleared myaelf. 
Ana now, suppose me to be her, 
let me hear your charge, a:id du 
i/im hear wliat the poor culprit can 
say to it in her own defeuce. And 
then answering the cnn/c'fura/aud 
iifip-oDKd circumstances by circum- 
stances as fairly to be supposed 
favourable, she brought off tri- 
umphantiy theceusuredlady; and 
to much to every one's satisfaction, 
that she was led to her chair, and 
voted a double rank in the circle, 
— as the re-instated Miss Fanny 
Durliogton, and as Miss Clarissa' 



iUiOwn. -133 

Very few persons , she used to 
say, would be condemned, or even 
accused, in the circles of ladies, 
were they present; it is gonerouH 
therefore, nay, it is but just, said 
ihe,to take the port of theubsuat, 
if not flagrantly culpable. 

But though icix'hm was ber 

■iliritjhi, as I may say, yet she 
had not lived years enough to pre- 
tend to so much experience, as to 
exempt her from the necessity oi' 
sometimes altering her opinion 
both of persona and things: but, 
when she foundherself obliged to 
do this, she took care, that llic 
particular instance of mistaken 
worthiness in the person should 
not narrow or contract her almost 
universal charity into generul 
doubt or jealousy. Au instance 
of what 1 mean, Qceors to oiy

she naed to Ba,y, "next in degree 
to that of having avoided error, 
frankly to own an error. And that 
the offering at an excuse in a 
blameable manner, was the un- 
doubted mark of a disingenuous, 
if not of aperrerse mind. 

Uut 1 oughtto add, on this head 
[of her great charity where char- 
acter was concerned , and where 
tliere was Toom for charity] that 
she was always deservedly severe 
in her reprehensions of a wilful 
and ftiiitiai vilenees. How conld 
she then forgive the wretch by

You must every where insist

On this head you may take no-

generally so averse as they are to

for improvement, as amusement: 
"Who sees not," would she aay, 
"that those women who take de-

aimed at aiiy thiug but oxcelling 
in the knomedge of the beauties 
and graceB of their mother- 
tongue: and once she said, that 
Ihisiraa firld enough for a woman; 
aud tin ampler vme but endanger- 
ing her family usefulness. But I, 
who think oar sei inferior in no- 
thing to the other, but in want of 
opportonities, of which the nar- 
row-minded mortals indufltrioualy 
seek to deprive us, lest we should 
surpass them asmuchinwhat they 
chiefly value themselveB upon, aa 
we do in all the graces of a fine 
imagination, coiud never agree 
with her in Ihut. And yet 1 was 
entirely of her opinion, that those 
women who were Bolicitous to ob- 
tain that knowledge or leaniing, 
which they HUppoaed would add to 
their significance in sensible com- 
pany, and in their attainment of it 
imagined themselves above all 
domestic UBefulnc^, deservedly 
incurred the contempt which they 
hardly ever failed to meet with. 

Perhaps you will not think it 
amiss fiirther to observe on tli ' 
liead, as it will shew that VJr^'L't 
and iwiiHptfi always wont hand 
hand with her, that her dairy at 
her grandfather's was the delight 
of every one who saw it; and she 
of all who saw her in it. 

Her grandfather, in honour of 
her dexterity and ofher skill in all 
the parts of Uie dairy manage- 
ment, as well as of the elegance of 
the offices allotted for that use, 
would have hie scat, before known 
by the name of ilw Gno-a, to be 



called the Diiiry-liii'ii^c^. She had 
an easy, con veui cat, and graceful 
habit made on purpose, which she 
pat on when she employed herself 
in these works; and it was noted 
of her, that in llm name, hiur tiat 
she appeared t.o be amost elegant 
dairy-maid, she was, when called 
to a change of dreaa, the finest 
lady that ever graeed a circle. 

Her grandfather, father, mo- 
ther, uncles, aunt, and oven her 
brother and sister, made her Ire- 
(juent visits there, and were de- 
lighted with her silent ease, and 
unafiected behaviourinhcr works ; 
for she always out of modesty 
chose rather the operalive than the 
lUrcdh'e part that she might not 
discourage the servant whose 
proper business it was. 

Each was fond of taking a re- 
gale from her hands in her Diutji- 
hoiifif. Her mother and aunt 
Hervey generally admired her in 
silence, that they might notgive 
uneasiness to her sister; a spite- 
ful, perverse, uuimitatiug thing,

owed to her family; whose iif 
rowneBB, immenaelj rich, and ii 
ineusely carking, put them upon

to this part of knowledge: 
her eltfer aiater affected dress 
without being gracefulinit; aod 
the fine lady, which she could 
never be; and which her sister 
was without studying for it, or 
seeming to know she was so. 

It was usual with the one sister, 
when company was eipectedj to 
be half the morning dressmg; 
while the other would give direc- 
tions for the whole business and 
entertainment of the day, and 
then go up to her dressing-room, 
and, before she could be well 
missed, [haumgallherlMrigs

graceful ease and tranquillity as if 
she had had nothing cue to think

Long after her [hours perhaps of 
previous preparation having pass-

of it, at the firatot our happy inti-

you, not only of present, but of 
future imporluaity." — An indul-

Again, "I know you will favour

And I once pleading a cold, the

to be entreated — "Sing however,

tiea; whose whole time, in the 
short days tbcy generally make, 
and in the inverted night aiid day, 
where they make them longer, is 
wholly spent in dress , visits, 
cards, playa, operas, and musical 
entertainmeiitB, woDder at what I 
have written, and shall further 
write: and let them look upon it 
as an incredihle thing, that when, 
at a mature age, thcj cannot 
boast one of her perfections, there 
should have been a lady so young, 
who had 30 many. 

These must be such as know not 
how she employed her time; and 
cannot form tlio leaat idea of what 
may be done in those hours in 
which they Ue ejiFntoped milh tie 
aharks of dcaOi , as she used to call 

But before I come to mention 
the distribution she usually made 
of her lime, let me aay a fewworda 
upon another subject , in which 
she eiicelled all the young ladies 1 
ever knew. 

This was her skill in almost all 

L BortE of fine needleworks .- of 

[ which, however, I shall say the 

less since possibly you will find it 

mentioned in some of the letters. 

That piece which she bequeaths 
to her cousin Morden, is indeed 
a capital piece; a performance 
so admirable , that that gien- 
tlGman'siather,whoresidodchiQfly 
abroad , (was, as is mentioned in 
her will,) very desirous to obtain 
it, in order to carry it to Italy with 
him , to shew the curious of nther 
countries, (as he used to say) for 
the honour of Ui nicn, that the 
cloistered confinement was not 



ssary to inakeEnglish womnn 
excel in any of tlioHO fine arts 
upon which nuns and recluses 
value themselves. 

ller quickness at these sorts of 
works was astonishing; and a 
great encouragement to herself to 
prosecute them. 

Mr. Morden's father would have 
been continually making* her 
presents would shehave permitted 
him to do bo; and he used to call 
them, and so did her grandfather, 
tributes due to a merit so Bove- 



complishments and aoi|iiirements 
she was mistress of, will show what 
they must have been. She was far 
from being fond of rrtrHs, the 
fashionable foible of modem 
ladies: nor, aa will be easily per- 
ceived from what I have said , and 
from what I shall further 
aay, had she much time for play. 
She never therefore promoted 
their being called for; and often 
insensibly diverted the company 
from tlimn , by starting some 
entertaining subject, when she 
could do it without incurring the 
imputation of particularity. 

Indeed very few of her intimates 
would propose cards, if they could 
engage her to read, to talk, to 
touch the keys, or to sing, when 
any new hook, or new piece of 
music, came down. But when com- 
pany was so numerous, that con- 
versation could not take that 
agreeable turn which it oftenest 
does among four or five friends of 
like years and inclinations, and it 
became in a manner oeeewAri^ 



142 

detach off aorae of it, to make the 
rest better company, she would 
not refuse to pluj, if, upon cast- 
ing-in, it fell to her lot. Asd then 
she siiewed that her dis-reliah to 
cards was the effect of choice 
ontj; and that she was an ea,sy 
mistress of every genteel game 
played with them. But then she 
Silways declared against playing 
high. "Except for trifles," she 
used to say, "she would not sab- 
tnit to oAanoe what she was already 
iure of." 

At other times, "She would 
make her friends a very ill compli- 
ment, "shesaid, "if sho supposed 
they would wish to be possessed 
of what of riclit belonged to her ; 
and she should be very unworthy 
if she desired to make herself a 
title to what was theirs." 

"High gaming, in short," she 
■used to say, "was a sordid vice; 
lu immorality ; the child of 
avaric«; and a direct breacli of 
that commandment, which forbids 
I to covet what is our neigh- 
She was exeeedingly charit- 
able; the only one of her family 
that knew the mcauiog of the 
word: and this with regard both 
to the Bouls and the bodies of 
those who were the well-chosen 
objects of her benevolence. She 
kept a list of these, whom she 
used to call Aerpuor, entering one 
upon it as another was provided 
for, hy death or any oi 
but always made a reser 
tbeless, for unforeseen casea , aaiA

dent distribution of them, she had 
neither example nor equal. 

The aged, the blind, the lame, the 
widow, the orphan, the Dnsuccesa- 
ful industrious, were particularlj' 
the objects of it; ana the contn- 
butiug to the schooling of some, 
to the putting out to trades and 
husbandry the children of othere 
of the labouring or needy poor, 
and setting them forwara at the 
expiration of their servitude, were 
her great delights; as was the 
giving eood books to others; and, 
when she had opportunity , the 
instructing the poorer sort of her 
honest neighbours, and father's 
tenants, in the use of them. "That 
charity," she used to say, "which 

' viduB toT the 7H0 rain, aswellai 
the bodily u-mils of the poor, 
gives adouble benefit to theptWir, 
as it adds to the number of tho 
^o^/u^, what it takes from thai ol' 
the VTojUgate. And can there bp, 
in the eyes of that God, she was 
wont to say, who requires nothing 
so much from us as acts of bene- 
ficence to one another, a charity 
more worthy?" 

Her nnele Antony, when be 
came to settle in England, with 
bis vast fortune obtained in Ihc 
Indies, used to say, "This girl by 
her charities will bring down a 
blessing upon us all." Anditniual 
be owned they trusted pretty 
much on this presumption. 

But I need not say more on this 
head; nor perhaps wits it neces- 
sary to say so much; since the

In all her readings, and in her 
conversations upon them, she was 
fonder of finding beauties than 
biemiBhes, and chose to applaud 
both authors and books, where 
shecontdfindthe least room for it. 
Vet she used to lament, that cer- 
tain writers of the first class, who 
were capable of exalting virtue, 
and of putting vice out of coun- 
tenance, too generally employed 
themselves in works of imagina- 
lion only, upon subjects mertlij 
spei^daiwe, dtsmieTesling, and i«i- 
edifying; from which no useful mo- 
ral iir example could be drawn. 

But she was a severe ceiiaurer 
of pieces oi a light or indecenl tam, 
which had a tendency to corrupt 
the morals of youth, to convey 
polluted images, or to wound 
religion, whether in itself, or 
through the sides of its professors, 
and thiswhoever were the authors, 
and how admirable soever the 
execution. She often pitied the 
celebrated Dr. Swift for so em- 
ploying his admirable pen, that a 
pure eye was afraid of looking 
mto his works, and a pure ear of 
hearing any thing quoted from 
them. "Such authors," shensed 
to say, "were not honest to their 
own talents, nor grateful to the 
God who gave them." Nor would 
she, on these occasions, admit 
their beauties as a palliation; on 
the contrary , she neld it as an 
aggravation of their crime, that 
they who are so capable of mend- 
in/; thi: heart, should in any places

eicellencies, she was forwarder to 
Iwar than ^jieoi'; and hence, no 
doubt, derived no small part of 
her improvement. 

Althongh she was well read in 
thcEogli^, French, and Italian 

fioet^, and had read the best trana- 
atioDsof the Latin Classics; jet 
neldom did she quote or repeat 
from tb em, cither in her letters or 
eonversation, though exceedingly 
happy in a tenacious memory; 
principally through modesty, and 
to avoid the imjiutation of that 
affectoiion which I have Just men- 
tioned,

•a; he has beeu tljsciplined into 
greater improvement, than she 
nad made from the mere force of 
^uiuB and application. But it is 
demonatrabk to all who know 
how tomake observations on their 
acquaintance of both sexes, ar- 
rogant aa some are of their Buper* 
ficialitieb, that a lady at eightee 
take tho world through, is mo 
prndent and conversable than 
man at twentyfive. I can prove 
this by nineteen instances out of 
twenty in my onn knowledge. 
Yet how do these poor boasters 
value themselves upon the advan- 
tages their education gives them ! 
Wno has not seen some of them, 
just come from the university, dis- 
dsinfully smile at a mbtaken oi 
ill-pronounced moril from a lady, 
when her same has been clear, and 
herseutimentsjnst; and when he 
could not himaelf utter a, s' ' 
sentence fit to be repeated, . 
what he had borrowed from the 
authors he had been obliged to 
study, as a ^ainfol exercise to 
alow and creeping parts? But how 
'diRresE! 

Thie eicellcnt younc lady used 
) say, "it was incredible to think. 
hat might be done by ^urig 
rising, and by loni/ 'lin/s well filleil 
np." 

It may be added, that she cal- 
culated according to the practice 
ottuntHany, she had actually lived 
more years at sixteen, than l/iei/ 
had at Ifeenty-six. 

She was of opinion, "that no 
f one could sucnd their time pro- 
kjKrly, who did not live b^ acme 
""■lo; whodidnot approprialotlv 



hours, as near as might be, to par- 
ticular purposes and employ- 
ments." 

In conformity to this self-set 
lesson, the usual distributiou of 
the twenty-four houni, when left 
to her owu choice, was as fol- 

F„r REST she oUutted SlXhours 
only. 

She thought herself not so well, 
and so clear in her intellects, [so 
much alive, she used to say] ifsne 
exceeded this proportion. If she 
slept not, she chose to rise sooner. 
And in winter had her fire laid, 
and a taper ready burning to light 
it; not loving to give trouble to 
servants, ''whose harder work, 
and later hours of going to bed," 
she used to say, " required consi- 
deration." 

I have blamed her for her 
greater regard to them, than to 
herself. But this was her answer: 
" I have my choice : tp/m can wish 
for more? Why should I oppress 
others , to gratify myself? You 
sec what ^res-wffl enables one to 
do; white inij'osllioit would make 
" light burden heavy."

and in a regimen, he generally 
made his visits in the afternoon, 
ONE Hour to Visits to the ntigk- 

liouring Poor; 
To a select number of whom, 
and to their children, she used to 
give brief instructions , and good 
books: aud as this happened Dot 
every day, aod seldom above 
twice a week, she had two or 
three hours at a time to bestow in 
this benevolent employment. 

Tlie remaviing FOUR noun 
Were occasionally allotted b) 
supper, to conversation, or to 
reading after supper to the fii- 
mily. This allotment she called 
her fund, upon which she used 
to draw, to satisfy her other de- 
bits: and in this she included 
visits received and returned, 
shows, spectacles, &c. which, in 
a country-life, not occurring eveij 
day, she used to think a great 
allowance, no less than tuyii days 
msir, for amusements only: and 
she was wont to say, that it waa 
hard if she could not steal time 
out of thisfund, for an excursion 
of even two or three days in a 
month, 

If it be s^d, that her relations, 
or the young neighbouring Isdie*. 
had but litlJe of her time, it will 
he considered, that besides these 
four hours in the twenty-fimr, 
great part of the time she was W- 



r 

■ , and it was a custom she had intro- 
K'duced among her acquaintance, 
[T tjiat the young ladies in their 
visits used frequently , in a. neigh- 
bourly way, (in the winter even- 
ings eBpeoiailj) to hring their 
work with them- and one of half a 
dozen of her aelect acqunintauce 
■nsed by turna to read to the rest 
»fia they were at work. 

This was her usual method 
I when at her own command for six 
days in the week. 

Tl>e SEVENTH DAY, 
She kept as it ought fo be kept: 
^^■nd as some part of it was fre- 
nquently employed in works of 
tnercy, the hoar she allotted to 
Visitmg the neighbouring poor 
^rns oceasionalty supplied iroin 
this day, and added to her fund. 

But I must obaerpe, that when 
n her grandfather's lifetime she 
nas three or four weeks at a time 
his housekeeper and guest, as 
also at either of her uncles , her 
UBual distribution of time was 
Tsried: hut still she had an eye 
to it as nearly as circumstances 
would admit. 

When I had the happiness of 
having her for my guest, for a 
■fortnight or so , she likewiBe dis- 

Sensed with her rulea , in mete in-

ihabits; for I also (thoagh I had

time; and can witness to the 
benefit I found by it in my health ; 
as also to the many useful things 
I waa enabled by that means wim 
eaae and pleasure to perform. 
And in her aeeount-book I have 
found thia memorandnra since her 
ever-to-be lamented death; — 
"From svch a ihiij to nurli a day, 
all holidays, at my dear Miss 
Howe's," At her return r "Account 
resumed, suek a iJai/ ," naraiugit; 
and then she proceeded regularly, 
as before. 

Once a week she used to reckon 
with herself; when, if within the 
144 hours, contained in the six 
days, she had made her account 
even , she noted it accordingly ; if 
otherwise she carried the debit 
to the neit week's account; as 
thus: debtor to ike article af bene- 
volent visits, so many hours. And 
so of the rest. 

But it was always an especial 
part of her care, that whether 
visiting or visited, she shewed in 
all companies an entire ease, 
satisfaction, and cheerfulness, as 
if she kept no such particular ac- 
count, and ns if she did not make 
herself answerable to herself for 
her occasional proceedings. 

This method, which to others 
wUl appear perplexing and un- 
necessary, her earli/ hours, and 
custom, had made pleasant and 

And indeed, as I used to tell 
her, greatly as 1 admired her in 
all her methods , I could not bring 
myself to this, might 1 have had 
the world for my reward.

So vana , yet ao cool a frii'Ttd 1 
So mach what I nisb to be, but 
never shall be! — For, alas! my 
stay , my adviser , my monitreBB, 
my directresB, is gone! for ever 
gone! She honoured me with the 
title of the sister of her heart: butl 
wiu only BO in the lore I bore her, 
(a love beyond a siater'a — in- 
finitely beyond her alBter's!) in 
the hatred I have to every mean 
and sordid aetioa ; and in my love 
of virtue: for otherwise, I am of 
a high and haughty temper, as 1 
have acknowledged heretofore. 
and very violent in my paaaions. 

In ehort, she was the nearest 
perfection of any creature 1 ever 
knew. She never preached to me 
lessons which she practised not 
herself. She lived the life she 
taught. All humility, meekness, 
self-accusing, others acquitting', 
though the shoifiiw of the fanit 
was nardly hers, the n<ibstance 
theirs, whose only honour was 
their relation to her. 

To lose such a friend, such a 
guide — if ever my violence was 
justifiable, it is upon thin recollec- 
tion! For Bhe only lived to make 
me sensible of failings, but not 
long enough to enable me to con- 
quer them; as I was resolved. to 
endeavour to do. 

Once more then let me execrate

I can't bear to be threatened,

qnestioned, give himself airs in 
my absence, if 1 know it, that shall 
make me look mean in any body's 
eyes: that shall give my frienda 
pain for me : that shall put them 
upon wishing me to change my in- 
tentions, ormyplan,to avoid him. 
Upon snch despicable terms as 
these , think you that I could bear 

Butwhy, if such were his pur- 

Kse, did he not let me know it 
fore I left England V Was he 
unable to work himself up to a 
reaolutjon, till lie knew me to be 
out of the kingdom? 

As soon as I can infoim myself 
where to direct to him, I will write 
to know his purpose: forleannot 
bear suspense m ench a case as 
this: that solemn act, were it even 
to be marriage or hanging, which 
must be done to-morrow, I had 



rather-^should be done to-day. My 
mind tires and sickens with impa- 
tience on ruminating upon scenes 
that can neither afford variety nor 
certainty. To dwell twenty days 
in expectation of an event that 
may be decided in a quarter of an 
hour, ia grievous. 
If hecometoParis, althoughl 



easily find out my liiili/iiiifs 
every day see some or other of my

play, and appear nt court, and at 
all public places. And, on my 
(juitting this city, will leave a 
direction whither my letters fijom 
ECugland, or elsewhere, shall from 
time to time be forwarded. 

Werelsure, that his intention 
is what Joseph Leman tells me it 
is, I would stay hcrCj or ehoilen 
his course to me, let bim be where 
he would. 

I cannot get off my regrets on 
account of this dear lady for the 
blood of me. If the colonel and 
I are to meet, as he has done me 
no injury, and loves tho memory 
of his cousin , we shall engage 
with the same sentimenta, as to 
the object of our dispute; and 
that, you know, is no very eom- 

In short, I am as much con- 
vinced that I have done wrong, as 
he can be; andregi'et it as much.

by any man in the world, however

I CAMNUT think, my deiir Love- 
lace, that Colonel Morden has 
either threatened you in those 

froHS terms mentioned by the vile, 
ypocritioalj and ignorant Joseph 
Leman, or intends to follow you. 
They are the words of people of 
that fellow's class; and not of a, 
gentleman : not of Colonel Mor- 
den, I am sure. You'll observe, 
that Joseph pretends uot to aay 
that he heard him speak them. 

I have been vnry eolicitous to 
sound the colonel, for your sake, 
and for his own, find for the sake 
of the injunctions of the excellent 
ladj to me , as well us to him , on 
thatsubject. Heis (andvouwUl

beloved cousin's case been that of

any resolutions ; nor had he de- 
clared himself to the family is 
such a way as should bind hlin to

will it he known, that your plan

aa skilful. But vet 1 will add, 
that if I had a value for my Ufe, 
he should be the last man, eieept 
yourself, with whom I would 
choose to have a contention. 

I have, as you required, been

I have not aimed at palliation. 
If ^ou seek not Colonel Morden, 
it IB my opinion he will not seek

I should have been very glad, 
thatyouhad thought Ibad jiunish-

the wroaea I have done to the 
moat eicel lent of women ; and that 
it had been possible for two per-

in pursuance of his answer to my

been at Preshurg, and had in- 
tended to visit some other cities of

That I might not appei

for this city the vainest morning. 
I knew not but that tbe politeueEs 
of this court might have engaged, 
beyond his intention, a gentleman 
wlto has only his pleasure to pur- 

lut being disappointed in my 
hope of finding you here, it be- 
comesmc toacij^uaint you, that 1 
have such a desire to stand veil in 
theopinionofaman of your spirit, 
thai I cannot hesitate a moment 
upon the option, which lam sure 
Mr. Lovelace, in my situation, 
(thus called upon) would make. 

I own, sir, that I have, on all 
occasions, apoken of your treat- 
ment of my ever-dear cousin as it 
deserved. It would have been 
very surprising if I had not. And 
it behoves me (now youhave given 
me BO noble an opportunity of ex- 
plaining myself) to convince you, 
that no words fell from my lips, of 
you, merely because you were 
absent. I acquaint you, there- 
fore, that 1 will attend your ap- 
pointmcnt; and would, were it tc 
the farthest part of tbe globe. 

1 shall stay some days at this 
court; and if you please to direct

not know it, if she had not told me, 
that she could not be guilty of affec-

she intended to marry f* I knew, 
as she once upbraided me, that 
from the time I had got her from 
her father's house , 1 had a plain 
path before me.** True did she 
say, and I triumphed in the dis- 
covery, that from thBft time I had 
held her soul in suspense an hundred 
times.*** My ipecacuanha trial 
alone was enough to convince an 
infidel, that she had a mind in 
which love and tenderness would 
have presided, had I permitted 
the charming buds to put forth 
and blow.f

Hr. LQVelaee to Jobs Belford, Esq. 
Trent, Dec. J-W. 

To-uoeaow ia to be the diy 

that will, in all probability, sena 
either one or two ghosts to attend 
themaneaof my Clabissa. 

1 arrived here yesterday; m3 
inquiring for an English gen- 
tleman of the name of Morden, 
soon found out the colonel'i 
lodgings. He had been in tewn 
two days; and left his name at 
every probable place. 

He was gone to ride out; and I 
left m'j name, and where to U 
found; and in the evening be 
made tne a visit. 

He was plaguy gloomy. Tb»t 
was not I. But yot he told m^ 
that I had acted like a man oi 
true spirit in my first letter; and 
with honour, in giving him to 
readily this meeting. He wished 
'^"^ in other respects; and than 
ight have seen ea(^ othfJ 
upon better terms than now <fi! 
did. 

I said, there was no recalliag 
'hat was passed; and that 1

done, as well as he.

would be as eiasperatmg as on-

The two latter be yours, Mr. 

Morden. The time to-morrow, 

or next day, as jouplease. 

I Neitdsy, then, Mr.LoTelace; 

I ajid we'll ride out to-morrow, to 

fix the plaue. ; 

Agreed, sir. | 

Well; now, Mr. Lovelace, dO| 

you chooae the weapou. 

I said , I believed we might be 
upon equal foot with the single 
I rapier; but, if be thought other- 
wise, I bad no objection to a 

I I will only say , replied he , that 
, the chances may be more equal 
I by the sword, becauae we can 
I neither of us be to seek in that: 
and you would stand 



nritb 



pistol; and yet I have brought 
two, that you may take your 
choice of either: for, added be, 
I never missed a mark at pistol- 
distance, since I knew bow to 
bold a pistol. 

I told him, that he spoke like 
himself: that I was expert enough 
that way, to embrace it, if he 
chose it; though not so sure of 
my mark as he pretended to be. 
Yet the devil's irft, colonel, ifl, 
who have slit a bullet in two upon 
a, knife's edge, bit not my man. 
So I have no objection to a pistol, 
if it be i/uur choice. No man, 
I'll venture to say, has a steadier 
band or eye than I have. 

They may both be of use to 
you, sir, at the sword, as well as 
at the pistol: the aword therefore 
be the thing, if you please. 



With all my heart. 

We parted with a solemn sot 
of ceremonious civility: and thi 
day I called upon him; and wt 
rode out together to fii npon thi 
place: and both being of on< 
mind, and hating to put off foj 
the morrow what could be doni 
to-day. would have decided ii 
then: but Ue la Tour, and th< 
colonel's valet , who attended ns 
being unavoidably let into th( 
secret, joined to beg no would 
have with us a surgeon from 
Briien, whom La Tour had fallen 
in with there , and who bad told 
,him he was to ride next morning 
to bleed a person in a fever, at 
a lone cottage, which by the 
surgeon's description was not far 
from the place where we then 
were, if it were not that very 
cottage within sight of us. 

They undertook so to manage 
it, that the surgeon should know 
nothing of the matter till his 
assistance was called in. And 
La Tour being, as I assured the 
eolonel,a ready contriving fellow, 
[whom t ordered to obey him ai 
myself, were the chance to be in 
his favour] we both agreed to 
defer the decision till to-morrow, 
an{l to leave the whole about the 
surgeon to the management of 
our two valets; enjoining them 
absolute secrecy: and so rods 
back again by different ways. 

We fixed upon a little lone 
valley for the spot — Ten to- 
morrow morning the lime — and 
single rapier the word. Yet I re- 
peatedly told him, that I valued 
myself so much upon my skill in

the gentlemen^ with the greatest 

ErBaeoce uf mind that ever I be- 
eldinineu, atript to their sliirta, 
anddren. 

They parried with equal judg- 
ment several passes. Mj clievalier 
drew the first blood, makiog a 
desperate push, which, by a sud- 
den torn of his aatagoniat, missed 
going clear through him, aod 
wounded bim ou the fleshj part of 
the ribs of his right side; which 
part the sword tore out, beine ou 
the extremity of the body: out, 
before my chevalier could recover 
himself, the colonel, in return, 
pushed hitu into the inside of 
the left arm, near the shoulder: 
and the sword (raking bis breast 
as it passed) being followed by a 
great effusion of blood, the colonel 
said, sir, I believe you have 
enough. 

My chevalier swore by G— d, 
he was not hurt; 'twas a pin's 
point: and bo made another pass 
athia antagouiat; whichhe, with 
a Burptiniiig dexterity, received 
under his arm, and run my dear 
chevalier into the body: who im- 
mediately fell; saying. The luck 
is yours , air — ^ O my beloved Cla- 
riaaa!^ Now art thou — inwardly 
he spoke three or fonr words more. 
His sword dropt from his hand. 
Mr. Morden threw his down, and 



Ah, 



saving in French —

— Call to Qfld for mercy ! 

We gave tlie signal agreed 

npon to the footmen; and they to 

the surgeons; who instantly came 

up. 



Colonel Morden, I found, was 
too well used to the bloody work; 
tor he was as cool as if nothing 
extraordinary had happened, aa. 
ctistiug the aurgeoua though his 
own wound bled much. But my 
dear chevalier fainted away two 
or three times running, and 
vomited blood besides. 

However, they stopped the 
bleeding for the preseut; and we 
helped him into the voiture : and 
thea the colonel suffered bis own 
wound to be dressed; andappeared 
concerned that my chevalier was 
between whiles (when he conld 
speak, and struggle) extremely 
outrageous. — Poor gentleman! 
he had made quite sure of tic- 

The colonel, against the lur- 
geons' advice, would mount on 
horseback to pass into the Vene- 
tian territories; and generously 1 
gave me a purse of gold to pay the 
surgeons; desiring me to make a 
present to the footman; and to 
accept of the remainder, aa a 
maik of his satisfaction in my con- 
duct, and iu my care and tender- 
ness of my master. 

The surgeons told him , that my 
chevalier could not live over the 

When the colonel took leave of 
him , Mr. Lovelace said , you 
have well revenged the dear crea-

you called upon me to this work,

piety of a confessor , (wriui 
Mr, Lovelace's hand) snatch tl

mendyonraclf to God. 

AndsD he rode off. 

The voiture proceeded slowly 
with my chevalier; yet the motion 
set both his wounds bleeding 
alresh; and it was with dilEculty 
they again stopped the blood. 

We brought him alive to 
nearest cottage; and he gave 
ders to me to dispatch to vou

and bid me write to you the parti-

for the satisfaction of aucb of the 
readers as may be presumed to 
have interested themselves iotbe 
fortunes of thoae other principals 
in the story, who Burvived Mr. 
Lovelace, will be found sum- 
marily related as follows : 

The news of Mr. Lotelacb's un- 
happy end waa received with as 
much grief by hia own relations, 
aa it was with esultation by the 
Harlowe family, and by 
Howe. Hia own family were 
to be pitied, because being sincere 
admirers of the inimttable lady, 
they were greatly grieved for the 
injustice done her; and now had 
the aiidiliimal mortification of 
losing the only raale of it, by a 
violent death.

haanotrecovered; nor is likely to 



a with, and 
title to assert, which admits of 
litigation; and he not blessed with 
so mnch patience as ia necessary 
to persons embarrassed in law. 

What is further observable in 
regard to him, is that the match 
was entirely of his own head, 
against the advice of his father, 
mother, and uncles, who warned 
biu of marrying in this lady a 
law-suit for life. His ungenerous 
behaviour to bis wife, for what she 
cannot help, and for what is aa 
much her misfortune as his, has oc- 
casioned such estrangements be- 
tween them (she being a woman 
of spirit) as, were bis law-suits 
determined, even more favour- 
ably than probably they will be, 
must make him unhappy to the 
end of bis life. He altributea all 
his misfortunes, when he opens 
himself to the few friends he has, 
to its vile and cruel trealmeni af his 
emijelio sister, fie confesses these 
misfortunes to be just without 
having temper to acquiesce in the 
acknowledged justice. One month 
in every year he puts on mourn-

with him on the 7th of September, 
during which he shuts himself up 
from all company. Finally , he if

She nBTBr was left out of any

considered as a principal peisoti 
in the frequent treats and enter-

of luxurious living, ^ve with a 
view to encrease their acquaint-

At fifteen or sixteen, she af- 
fected, both in dress and mauners, 
to ape such of the quality as were 
most apish. The richest silks in 
her father's shop were not too rich 
for her. At all public diversions 
she was the leader, instead of the 
led, of all her female kindred and 
acquaintance, though they were 
a third older than uerself. She 
would bustle herself into a place, 
and make room for her more 
bashful companions, through the 
trowuH of the first possessors, at 
a crowded theatre, leavtog every 
one near her amazed at her self-

She knew the chrisliaji, asw«lai

who frequented public placa;

Those who had not obeyed ths

it concerned to go forward 
rather than backward in outward 
appearances. Thej flattered them- 
selves, and they flattered their 
girl, and she was ciiiirety of their 
opinion , that she had charms and 
wit enough to attract some man 
of rank; of furhme at least: and 
yet this daughter of a mercer-fa- 
ther and grocer-mother could not 
bear the thoughts of a creeping 
cit; encouraging herself with a 
few instances {comjiaralively few) 
which she had always in her head 
aa common ones, of girls much in- 
ferior to herself in station, talents, 
education , and even fortune , who 
had succeeded — as she doubted 
not to succeed. Handsome settle- 
ments, and a chariot, that temp- 
tine gewgaw to the vanity of the 
middUng ctasB of females, were 
the least that ahe proposed to 
herself. But all this while, neither 
her parentsnor herself considered, 
that she had appetites indulged 
to struggle with, and a turn of 
education given her, as well as a 
warm constitution, unguarded by 
sound principles, and uuhene- 
fitted by example, which made her 
much better qualified for a mis- 
tress than a wife. 

Her twentieth year , to her own 
equal wonder and regret, passed 
over her head, and she had not 
had one offer that her pride would 
permit her to accept. A ^rlfcnsi

tl) en beginning to bloaaom, will, 
ae a neir tbiog, attract the eyes 
of men: but if she make her mcp 
oheflp at public placee, she wiil 
find, thfttnna faces mlldrawmore 
ftttentioD than fne faces con- 
■tantlj seen. Policy, therefore, 
if nothing else were conaidered, 
iTould iudiice a young beauty, if 
she could tame her vanity , just to 
ahew herself, and to be talked of, 
and then withdrawing, as if from 
discretion (and discreet it will be 
to do so) eipect to be sought after, 
rather than to be thought to seek 
for; only reviving now and then 
the memory of herself at the 

Eublic places in turn, if she find 
erself likely to be forgotten; and 
then she will be new again. But 
this observation ongbt young la- 
dies always to have in their heads, 
that they can hardly ever expect 
to gratify their vanity, aad at the 
same time gain tlie admiration of 
men worthy of making partners 
for life. They may, in short, have 
many admirers at public places, 
but not one lover. 

Sally Martin knew nothing of 
this doctrine. Her beauty was in 
its bloom , and yet she found ber- 
eelf neglected. "Sally Martin, 
the mercer's daughter; she never 
failsbeinghere; was the answer, 
and the accompanying ohaerva- 
tion, made to every questioner, 
irbo is that lady? 

At last her destiny approached. 
It was at a masquerade that she 
first saw the gay, the handsome 
Lovelace, who was just returned 
from his travels. She wi 
idiately struek with his 



and with the brilliant things that 
she heard fall from his lips sa he 
happened to sit near her. He, 
who was not then looking oat for 
a wife, was taken vfith Sally's 
smartness, and with an air that 
at the same time shewed her to 
be equally genteel and self'signi' 
licant; and signs of approbation 
mutually passing, he found no 
difficnky in acquainting himself 
where to visit her next day. And 
yet it was some mortification to % 
person of her self-conseauence, 
and gay appearance, tosatimitto 
be known by BO fine a young gen- 
tleman as no more than a mercer's 
daughter. So natural ia it for a 
girl, brought up aa Sally was. to 
be occasionally ashamed of those 
whose folly had set her above her- 
■elf. 

But whatever it might be to 
ally, it was no disappointment to 
Mr.XiOTelace, to find his miatress 
higher degree ; because be 
hoped to reduce her soon to the 
lowest condition that an unhappy 
—Oman can fall into. 

But when Miss Martin had in- 
formed herself Uiat her lover was 
the nephew and presumptive heir 
of Lord M. she thought him the 
very man for whom ahe had been 
so long and so impatiently look- 
ing out; and for whom it was 
worth her while to spread ber 
l«ila. And here it may not be 
amiss to observe that it is reiy 
probable, that Mr. Lovelace had 
Sally Martin in his thoughts, and 
perhaps two or three more whose 
j hopes of marriage from him had 
I led them to their ruin, when he 



r

drew tie following whimsical 

Sicture, in a letter to hia friend 
elford , not inserted in the pie- 
eeding collection. 

"Methinka," aaya he, "I gees 
young couple in courtship, having 
leach a design upon the other: 
■Uie girl plavB off; ehe is very 
'fcappj, as the is: she cfinnot he

pose , is one who does not confem 
tbalhe desires not that sheK*o(iMj 
abe holds ready a net under her 
apron; he another under hb coat; 
each intending to throw it over 
the other's neck; she over Lis, 
when her pride is gratified, and 
she thinks she can he sure of him ; 
he over hers, when the watched- 
for yielding moment has carried 
consent tuo far — and suppose he 
happens tji be the more dexterous 
of the two, and whips his net over 
her, before she can cost hers over 
himj how, I would fain know, can 
she be justly entitled to cry out. 
upon cruelty, barbarity, de- 
ception, aacrifices, and all the rest 
of the eiclamatorj' nonsense, with 
which the pretty fools in such a 
case, are wont to din the ears of 
their conquerors? Is it not just, 
tbiukest tliou, when she makes 
her appeals to gods and men, that 
hoth gods and men should laugh 
iftt her, and hitting her in the teeth 
'"rith her own felonious intentioaa, 
id her ait down patiently under 
^ier deserved disappointment?" 

In short, Sally's parents, as well 
as herself, encoui-aged Mr. Love- 
lace's visits. They thought they 
might uuat to a diBcretiou iu her 



475 

which she herself was too wise to 
douht. Pride they knew she had. 
And that, in these cases, is often 
called discretion. — Lord help the 
sex, saysLovelaue, if they had not 
pride! — Nor did they suapeot 
danger from that specious air of 
sincerity, and gentlenesB of man- 
ners, which he could assume or 
lay aside whenever he pleased. 

The second masquerade, which 
was no more than their third 
meeting abroad, completed her 
ruin, from so practised, though so 
young a deceiver i and that before 
she well knew she was in danger; 
for, having prevailed with her to 
go off with him about twelve 
o'clock to his aunt Forbes's, a 
idy of honour and fortune, to 

horn he had given reason to ex- 
pect her future niece [the only hint 
of marriage he ever gave herj , ha 
carried her to the bouse ot the 
wicked woman, who beajw the 

,me of Sinclair in these jiapers: 

id there, by promises, which she 
understood in the favourable 
sense (for where a woman loves, 
she seldom doubla enongh for her 
own safety) obtained an easy con- 
quest over a virtue that was little 

ore than nominal. 

He found it not difficult to in- 
duce her to proceed in the guilty 
commerce , till the effects of it be- 
came too apparent to be hid. Her 
parents then (in the first fury of 
lheirdisappoiutment,andveiation 
for being deprived of all hopes of 
such a son-in-law) turned her out 

Her disgrace thus published, 
she became hardened; and, pro-

B Touritemistreas she then was, she 
was 80 incensed against her 
parents for an iadigaity eo little

coming the favourite danghtw of 
her mother Sinclair, at the per-

man, she practised to faring on

though she was bo far gone, that 
it had like to have cost her her 
life.

fiding in, and daring woman; 
gbe ft creature of specious appear- 
ance and great art. 

A still viler wickedness, 
possible, remains to be told of 
SftUy Martin. 

Her father dying, her mother, 
in hopes to Tedai/a her, as she 
called it, proposed to her to quit 
, Uie bouseof the infamous Sinclair, 
to retire with her into the 



-_ jtry, where her disgrace, and 
her then wicked way oflife, wonid 
not be known; and there so to live 
avc appearancea; the only 
5he had ever taught her, 
besides that of endeavouring ra- 
ther to delude than be deluded. 

To this Sally consented; but 
with no other intention, aa she 
often owned (and gloried in it) 
than to cheat her mother of the 
greatest part of her substance, in 
revenge for consenting to mt 
being turned out of doors long be- 
fore , and by way of reprisal for 
having persuaded her fatlier, W 
she would have it, to cut her off, 
in his last will , ii-om any share in 
his fortune. 

This unnatural wickedness, in 
half a year's time, she brooght 
about; and then the serpent re- 
tired to ber obscene den withhei 
loila, laughing at what she had 
)ne; even after it had broken her 
mother's heart, as it did in a few 
months' time: a severe but juit 
punishment, for the unprincipled 
education she had given ber. 
". ought to be added, that tbti 
__ an iniquity, of which neither 
Mr. Lovelace, nor any of his 
friends, could bear to hear her 
boast; and always checked ber 
for it, whenever she did; con- 
demning it with one voice; and it 
is certain, that this and other in- 
stances of her complicated wicked- 
ness, turned early Lovelace's 
heart against her; and, b«d she 
not been subservient to him in bis 
other pursuits, he would not have 
enduredher: for,speakingof her, 
he would say, Let not any one re-

All that ia necessary to add to 
the history of these unhappy wo.

After the death of the profligale

the house — a gentleman of family, 
killed in it in a fray, contending 
with another for a new-vampea 
face. Sally was accused of hold-

his more favoured adverBary ran 
him through the heart, and then 
made off. And she being tried for 
her life, narrowly escaped. 

This accident obliged diem to 
break up house-keeping; andnot 
having been frugal enough of 
their lU-gotteii gains (laruhiog 
upon one, what they got fay an-

CONCLUSION. 



shall never fail while she lives. 
She has even engaged her mother 
to contribnte annually to it. And 
Mr. Hickman has appropriated 
twenty pounds a-jear to the same. 
In consideration of which she 
aUows hun to recommend four ob- 
jects yearly to partake of it. — 
Allows^ is her style; for she as- 
snmes the whole prerogative of 
dispensing this charify; the only 
prerogative she does or nas occasion 
to assume. In every other case, 
there is but one wiUbetween them ; 
and that is generally his or hers, as 
either speaks first, upon any sub- 
ject, be it what it will. Mrs. 
Hickman, she sometimes as plea- 
santly as generously tells him, 
must not quite forget that she was 
once Miss Howe, because if he 
had not loved her as such and with 
all her foibles, she had never been 
Mrs. Hickman. Nevertheless she 
seriously, on all occasions, and 
that to others , as well as to him- 
self, confesses, that she owes him 
unretumahle obligations for his 
patience wuh her in HER day, and 
for his generous behaviour to her 
in HIS. 

And still the more highly does 
she esteem and love him, as she 
reflects upon his past kindness to 
her beloved friend; and on that 
dear friend's good opinion of him. 
Nor is it less grateful to her, that 
the worthy man joins most 
sincerely with her in all those re- 
spectful and affectionate recollec- 
tions, which make the memory 
of the departed precious to sur- 
vivors. 



of humanity and affection, as to be 
unconcerned at the unhappy fate 
of his most intimatevfriend. Bat 
when he reflects upon the untimely 
ends of several of his companions, 
but just mentioned in the preced- 
ing history — on the shocking 
despondency and death of hispoor 
friend Belton — on the signal 
justice which overtook the wicked 
Tomlinson — on the dreadful exit 
of the infamous Sinclair — on the 
deep remorses of his more valued 
friend — and on the other hand, 
on the example set him by the most 
excellent of her sex — and on her 
blessed preparation, and happy 
departure — and when he con- 
siders , as he often does with awe 
and terror, that his wicked habits 
were so rooted in his depraved 
heart, that all these warnings^ and 
this lovely example, seemed to be 
hut necessary to enable him to 
subdue them , and to reform ; and 
that such awakening calls are 
hardly ever afforded to men of his 
cast, or (if they are) but seldom 
attended with such happy effects 
in the prime of youth, and in the 
full vigour of constitution : — when 
he reflects upon all these thinp, 
he adores the mercy, which 
through these calls has snatched 
him as a brand out of the fire: and 
thinks himself obliged to make it 
his endeavour to find out, and to 
reform, any of those who may have 
been endangered by his means; as 
well as to repair to the utmost of 
his power, any damage or mis- 
chiefs which he may have occa- 
sioned to others.

CONCLtTSION. 



Miss Pattt Montague, a fine 
young lady [to whom her noble 
uncle, at his death, devised the 
other moiety of his real and per- 
sonal estates, including his seat in 
Berkshire] lives at present with 
her excellent sister Mrs. Belford: 
to whom she removed upon Lord 
M/s death; but, in all probability, 
will soon be the lady of a worthy 
baronet, of ancient family, fine 
qualities, and ample fortunes, just 
returned firom his travels, with a 
character superior to theverygood 
one he set out with: a case that 
very seldom happens, although 
the end of travel is improvement. 

Colonel MoBDEN, who, with so 
many virtues and accomplish- 
ments cannot be unhappy, in 
several letters to the executor, 
with whom he corresponds firom 
Florence [having, since his un- 
happy affair witn Mr. Lovelace, 
changed his purpose of coming so 
soon to reside in England as he 
had intended] declares, tiiat al- 
though he thought himself obliged 
either to accept of what he took to 
be a challenge, as such: or tamely 
to acknowledge, that he gave up 
all resentment of his cousin s 



wrongs; and in a manner to beg 
pardon for having spokenfreelyof 
Mr. Lovelace behind his back; 
and although at the time he owns 
he was not sorry to becalledupon, 
as he was, to take either the one 
course or the other: yet now, 
cooUj reflecting upon his beloved 
cousm^s reasomngs against duel- 
ling; and upon the pric^ it had too 
probably cost the unhappy man; 
he wished he had more fuUy con- 
sidered those words in his cousin's 
postiiumous letter — "If God will 
allow him time for repentance, 
why should you deny it him?"* 

To conclude — The worthy 
widow Lovick continues to live 
with Mr. Belford; and by her pru- 
dent behaviour, piety, and useful- 
ness, has endeared herself to her 
lady, and the whole family. 



♦ Seyeral worthy persons have wished, 
that the heinous practice of duelling had 
been more forcibly discouraged, byway 
of note , at the conclusion of a work de- 
signed to recommend the highest and 
most important doctrines of Christianity; 
it is humbly presumed, that those per- 
sons have not sufficiently attended to 
what is already done on that subject in 
Vol. I. p. 254. and in Vol. IV. Letters

ways thonght , that sudden conver- 
sions, such especially , as were left 
to the candour of the reader to 
suppose and make out, had neither 
art nor nature nor even probability 
in them; and that they were more- 
over of very bad example. To 
have a Lovelace for a series of 
years glory in his wickedness, and 
think that he had nothing to do, 
but as an act of ^ace and favour 
to hold out his nand to receive 
that of the best of women, when- 
ever he- pleased, and to have it 
thought that marriage would be 
a sufficient amends for all his 
enormities to others as well as to 
her; he could not bear that. Nor 
is reformation as he has shewn in 
another piece*, to be secured by a 
fine face; by a passion that has 
sense for its object; nor by the 
goodness of a wife's heart, nor 
even example, if the heart of the 
husband be not graciously touched 
by the Divine finder. 

It will be seen, oy this time, that 
the author had a great end in 
view. He has lived to see scepti- 
cism and infidelity openly avowed, 
and even endeavoured to be 
propagated from the press: the 

freat doctrines of the gospel 
rought into question: those of 
self-denial and mortification blot- 
ted out of the catalogue of chris- 
tian virtues: and a taste even to 
wantonness for out-door pleasure 
and luxuiT, to the general ex- 
clusion of domestic as well as 
public virtue, industriously pro- 
moted amonff all ranks and de- 
grees of people. 

* Pamela. 



In this general depravity, when 

even the pulpit has lost great pait 

of its weight , and the clergy are 

considered as a body of interested 

men, the author thought he should 

be able to answer it to his oup 

heart, be the success what it 

, would, if he threw in his mite to- 

! wards introducing a reformatioii 

j so much wanted : and heimagiiMd, 

' that if an agje given up to diversion 

!and entertamment, he cou!^ steal 

■ in, as may be said, and investigate 

the great doctrines of Christianity

amusement, he shoula be moit 

likely to serve his purpose; re- 

membenng that of the poet: 

A verse may find him who a seimoii fli«*i 
And torn delight into a sacxifice. 

He was resolved therefore to 
attempt something that never yet 
had been done, fie considered 
that the tragic poets have as 
seldom made then: heroes true 
objects of pity, as the comic theirs 
laudable ones of imitation: and 
still more rarely have made them 
in their deaths look forward to a 
future hope. And thus , when they 
die they seem totally to perish. 
Death, in such instances, must ap- 
pear terrible. It must be con- 
sidered as the greatest eviL Bat 
why is death set in skoeking 
lights, when it is the universal 
lot? 

He has indeed thought fit to 
paint the death of the wicked as 
terrible as he could paint it. But

nature, softens the mind of the 
beholder with sentiments of pity 
and compassion, comforts liim; 
under bis own private nfliiction, 
and teaches hioi not to judge of 
men's virtues by their Huccesaes*, 
1 cannot think of one real bero in 
all antic|uity so far raised above 
human inlirmities , that he might 
not be very naturally represented 
in a tragedy as plunged in mia- 
fortuuee and calamities. The poet 
may still find out some prevailing 
passion or indiscretion in his 
character, and slievr it in such a 
manner as will sufHcieatly acquit 
Providence of any injustice in his 
sufferings: for, as Horace ob- 
serves, tlie best man is faulty, 
though not in so great a degree 
as those whom we generally call 

"If such a strict poetical JMstke 
(proceeds the letter- writer) as 
some gentlemen insist upon, were 
to be observed in this art, there

in the greatest point of glory and

morally vicious, and only poeli- 
cat/tj good, if Imay use thepbrase 
of our modern critics. The JEneid 
is filled with innocent unhappy 

CBrsous. Nisus and Eurywus, 
ausus and Pallas, come all to 
unfortunate ends. The poet 
takes notice in particular, that^ in 
the sacking of Troy, Ei^heus fell, 
who was the most just man 
among the Trojans :

Our ffUT readers are also desired 
to attend to what a celebrated 
critic* of a neighbouring nation 
sajB on the nature and design of 
tragedy, from the rules laid down 
by the same great ancient; 

"Tragedy," says he, "makes 
man minUsI, by representing the 
great masters of the earth 
humbled ; and it makes him lender 
and merdful, by shewing him the 
strange acddertU nf life, and the 
unforeneen disgraces to wliieh the 
moat important peiaons are sub- 
ject. 

"Bnt because man is naturally 
timorona and compassionate, he 
may fall into other eitrewes. Too 
much fear may shake his con- 
stancy of mind, and too much 
compassion may enfeeble his 
equity. 'Tia the business of tra- 
gedy to regulate these two weak-

Agamemnon her husband; yet we 
cannot see Hippolytus die oy the 
plot of his step-mother Phasdra, 
m Euripides, without compassion, 
because he died not, but for being 
chaste and virtuous." 

These are the great authorities 
BO favourable to the stories that 
end unhappily. And we beg leave 
to re-inforce this inference from 
them, that if the temporary suf- 
ferings of the virtuous and the 
good eau be accounted for and 
justified on Pagan principles, 
manymore,and inHnltely strouger 
reasons, will occur to a CtirisUan 
reader in behalf of what are called 
unhappy catastrophes, froln the 
I consideration of the doctrine of 
fiili're retcwdi; which is every 
where strongly enforced in thfl 
History of Clarissa. 

Ufthis(to give but one instance] 
an ingenious modern distinguish- 
ed by his rank, but much more 
for his escellcut defence of some 
of the most important doctrines of 
Christianity, appears convinced 
in the conclusion of a pathetic 
fimniidy, lately published; in 
which, afterhenad deplored, as a

selves in scripture phrase) the loss 
of an eicellent wife, he tiiUH con-

words of the FealmJst: 

"Aa for me," Bays he,* "ray feet

was too painful fur me. Until I 
went into the sanctuary of God; 
then understood I their end —

This is the Psalmiat't comfort 
and dependence. And shall man,

Begides nhat has been said 
above, and in the Preface, on this 
head, the following opinion of an 
ingenioaa and candid foreigner, 
on this manner of writing, may 
not be improperly inserted here. 

" The method which tbe author 
has pursued in the History of 
Clarissa, is the same as in the life 
of Pamela: both are related in 
familiar letters by the parties 
themselves, at the very time in 
which the events happened; and 
this method has given the author 
great advantages, which he conld 
not Lave drawn from any other 
species of narration. Tbe minate 
partieulara of events, tbe senti- 
ments and conversation of tbe 
EBTties, are, upon this plai 
ibited with all tbe warmth and 
spirit that the passion supposed 
to be predominant at the verv 
time could produce , and with all 
the distinguishing characteristics 
which memory can supply ii' " 
history of recent transactions. 

"Bomances in general, 
Marivaux's amongst others, 
whollyimprobable; because they 
suppose the history to be written 
after the series of events is closed 
by the catastrophe: a 
stance which implies a si

etters once written , the 
author has provided with great 
judgment, so as to render this cir-

it is presumed, that what this 
gentleman says of the difficulties 
attending a story thus given in 
the epistolary manner of writing, 
will not be found to reach tbe 
History before ns. It is very well 
accounted for in it, how the two 
principal female characters came 
to take BO ^eat a delight in writ- 
ing. Their subjects are not 
merely subjects of amusement;

THE HISTORY OF CLARISSA HAELOWE. 



Had I not Mien into fresh trou- 
bles, nhich disabled me for several 
days from holdtngapen, lahould 
not have forborne enquiring after 
Tonrhealth.and that of your son; 
for I should have been but I«o 
ready to impute your silence to 
the cause, to which, to my very 

r'est concern, 1 find it was owing, 
jiwy to Heaven, my dear good 
fnend, to give you comfort in the 
way most desirable to yourself. 

1 am exceedingly concerned at 
Miss Howe's writing about me to 
my friends. 1 do assure you, that 
I was as ignorant of her intention 
50 to do, as of the contents of her 
J letter. Nor has she yet let me 

tw (discouraged , I suppose , by 
_ ill success) that she did write. 
It is impossible tosharethedelight

Htwasbut yesterday thati wrote

is of that nature, which her un- 
ROiuibly eipressed lovo for me 



had made her take, an you wrote 
me word in your former. I was 
afraid that all Buch freedoms would 
be attributed to me. And I am 
sure, that nothing but my own ap- 
plication to my friends, and it full 
conviction of my contrition, will 
procure me favour. Least of nil 
canlexpect, that eitheryournie- 
diationorher8(botbof whosefond 
and partial love of me is ho well 
known) will avail me.

a,^eiitr 'jf^p^rptiofi,' than for an

• N6r let it be imagined, my dear 
and ever venerable friend, that 
my present turn of mind proceeds 
from gloominess or melancholy :for 
although it was brought on by dis- 
appointment (the world shewing 
me early , even at my first rushing 
into it, its true and ugly face ;) yei 
I hope, that it has obtained a better 
root, and will every day more and 
more, by its fruits, demonstrate to 
me , and to all my friends , that it 
has. 

Ihave written to my sister. Last 
Friday I wrote. So the dye is 
thrown. I hope for a gentle an- 
swer. But, perhaps, they will not 
vouchsafe me any. It is my first 
direct application, you know. 1 
wish Miss Howe had left me to my 
own workings in this tender point. 

It will be a great satisfaction to 
me to hear of your perfect re- 
covery, and that my foster- brother 
is out of danger. But why, said I, 
out of danger? — When can this be 
justly said of creatures , who hold 
y so uncertain a tenure ? This is 
one of those forms of common 
speech , that proves the frailty and 
the presumption of poor mortals, 
at the same time. 

Don't be uneasy you cannot 
answer your wishes to be with 
me. I am happier than I could 
have expected to be among mere 
strangers. It was grievous at 
first; but use reconciles every 
thing to UB. The people of the

who lodges in it [have I not said so 
formerly?] a good woman; who is 
the better for having been a profi- 
cient in the school of affliction. 

An excellent school! my dear 
Mrs. Norton, in which we are 
taught to know ourselves, to be 
able to compassionate and bear 
with one another, and to look up 
to a better hope. 

I have as humane a physician 
(whose fees are his least regard) 
and as worthy an apothecary , as 
ever patient was visited by. My 
nurse is diligent , obliging , silent, 
and sober. So I am not unhappy 
without: and within — 1 hope, my 
dear Mrs. Norton, that I shall bie 
every day more and more happy 
within. 

No doubt, it would be one of 
the greatest comforts I could 
know , to have you with me : you, 
who love me so dearly: who have 
been the watchful sustainer of my 
helpless infancy; you, by whose 
precepts I have been so much be- 
nefited! — In your dear bosom 
could I repose all my griefs: and 
by your piety and experience in 
the ways of Heaven , should I be 
strengthened in what I am still to 
go through. 

But, as it must not be, I will ac- 

?[uie8ce; and so, I hope, will you: 
or you see in what respects I am 
not unhappy; and in those that I 
am , they lie not in your power to 
remedy. 

Then, as I have told you, Ihave

that he who can ait down preme-

he imagines them aa easy to be 
imposed upon, as he can impose

In vain dost thou impute to

lady of parting with her clothes;

Her implacable friends have re- 
foeed her the current cash she lefl 
behind her; and wished, aa her 
inster wrote to her, toaeeherre- 
duced to want: probably there-

Oar friendships and intimacies, 
Lovelace, are only calculated for 
strong life and health. When 
sickness comes, we look round us, 
and upon one another, like 
frighted birds, at the sight of a

Try, Lovelace, if thou canst

words are swallowed up I 

For the arrows of the Almighty are

And I am full oftossings to and fro,

than for hid treasures?

I was not in safety; neither had I 
rest; neither was I quiet: yet trouble 
came. 

But behold God is mighty, and 
despiseth not any. 

He giveth right to the poor — And 
if they be bound in fetters, andholden 
in cords of affliction, then he sheweth 
them their works and their trans- 
gressions. — 

I have a little leisure, and am in 
a scribbling vein: indulge me, 
Lovelace, a few reflections on 
these sacred books. 

We are taughtto read the Bible, 
when children , and as a rudiment 
only; and as far as I know, this 
may be the reason , why we think 
ourselves above it, when at a 
maturer age. For you know, that 
our parents , as well as we , wisely 
rate our proficiency by the books 
we are advanced to , and not by 
our imderstanding of those we 
have passed through. But, in my 
nucleus illness,! had the curiosity, 
in some of my dull hours (lighting 
upon one in his closet) to dip into 
it: and then I found, wherever I 
turned , that there were admirable 
things in it. I have borrowed one, 
on receiving from Mrs. Lovick the 
above meditation; for I had a 
mind to compare the passages con- 
tained in it by the book, hardly 
believing they could be so exceed- 
ingly apposite as I find they are. 
And one time or other, it is very 
likely, that I shall make a resolu- 
tion to give the whole Bible a 
perusal, by way of course^ as I may 
say. 

This , meantime , I will venture 



B»T( 



to repeat, is uertaiu.tlmt the style 

ia that truly easj, simple, and 
natural oue , which we ahould ad- 
mire in other authors etcesaivply. 
Then all the world join in an opi- 
nion of the antiquity, and authen- 
ticity too, of the book; and the 
leartied. are fond of strengthening 
their different arguments by its 
sanetiona. Indeed, I was eo much

Oddenongh, with all onr pride 
of leaniing, that we choose to 
derive the little we know from the 
under cuirenls, perhaps muddy 
ones too, when the clear, the 
pelhieid fountain head, is much 
nearer at hand, and easier to be

she fits out and portions as her

tobuy any thing at alessratfl than

advised her to the air, and blamed 
her for BO greut an application, as 
he was told she made to her pen; 
and he gave it as the doctor's 
opinion, as well as his own, that 
Blie would recover, if she herself 
desired to recover , and would use 
the means.

served, oa several occaaions, that 
when the medical men are ata loss 
what to prescribe, they enquire 
what their patients best like, or 
are moat diverted with, and forbid 
them that. 

But, noble-minded as they see 
this lady is, they know not half 
her nobleness of mind nor how 
deeply she is wounded; and de- 
pend too much upon her youlh, 
which I donbt will not do in this 
ease; and upon lime, which will 
not alleviate the woes of such a 
mind: for, having been bent upon

other views in living, than the 
common ones of eating, sleeping, 
dressing, visiting, and those other 
fashionable amusements , which 
fill up the time of most of her sex, 
especially of those of it, who think 
themselves fitted to shine in and 
adorn polite assemblies. Her erief , 
in short, seems to me to be oisuch 
a nature, that iime^ which alleviates 
most other persons* afflictions, 
will, as the poet says, give encrease 
to hers. 

Thou, Lovelace, mightest have 
seen all this superior excellence, 
as thou wentest along. In every 
word, in every sentiment, in every 
action is it visible. — But thy 
cursed inventions and intriguing 
spirit ran away with thee. 'Tis 
fit that the subject of thy wicked 
boast, and thy reflections on ta- 
lents so egregiously misapplied, 
should be thy punishment and thy 
curse. 

Mr. Goddard took his leave; 
and I was going to do so too, when 
the maid came up , and told her, 
a gentleman was below, who very 
earnestly enquired after her 
health, and desired to see her: his 
name Hickman. 

She was overjoyed; and bid 
the maid desire the gentleman to 
walk up. 

I would have withdrawn; but 
I suppose she thought it was 
likely I should have met him 
upon the stairs; and so she for- 
bid it. 

She shot to the stairs-head to 
receive him, and, taking his hand, 
asked half a dozen questions (with- 
out waiting for any answer) in re- 



lation to Miss Howe*s health; 
acknowledging, in high terms, her 

foodness in sending him to see 
er, before she set out upon her 
little journey. 

He gave her a letter from that 
voung lady which she put into her 
bosom , saying , she would read it 
by-and-by. 

He was visibly shocked to see 
how ill she looked. 

You look at me with concern, 
Mr. Hickman, said she — O sir! 
times are strangely altered with 
me, since I saw you last at my 
dear Miss Howe's! — What a 
cheerful creature was I then! — 
my heart at rest! my prospects 
charming! and beloved by every 
body ! — but I will not pain you ! 

Indeed, madam, said he, I am 
grieved for you at my soul. 

He turned away his face , with 
visible grief in it. 

Her own eyes glistened : but she 
turned to each of us, presenting 
one to the other — him to me, as 
a gentleman truly deserving to be 
called so — me to him, as your 
friend , indeed [how was I at that 
instant, ashamed of myself!] but, 
nevertheless , as a man of humani- 
ty; detesting my friend's base- 
ness ; and desirous of doing her all 
manner of good offices. 

Mr. Hickman received my civi- 
lities with a coldness, which, how- 
ever, was rather to be expected on 
your account, than that it deserved 
exception on mine. And the ladv 
invited us both to breakfast with 
her in the morning; he being 
obliged to return the next day. 

I left them together , and called

Dor professions to Miss Howe; 
ad Mita Howe's opinion, that 
lUiying you was the only way 
pw left to repair her wrongs. 

Mr. Hickman, as I also gAther- 
9, had pressed her, in Miss Hoire's 
une, to let her, on her i-eturn 
ram the Isle of Wight, £nd her at 
.neighbouring farmhouse., where 
eat apartments would be made 
«ady to receive her. She asked 
WW long it would be before they 
xtomed? And he told her, it 
proposed to be no more tlutn ,

she said, she should then perhaps 
have time to consider of that kind 
proposal. 

He had tendered her money 
from Mis3 Howe; but could not 
induce her to take any. No won- 
der I was refused! she only said, 
that if she had occasion, she would 
be obliged to nobody but Miss

At her desire he sat down with us. 
Mr. Hickman asked him, if he 
could give him any consolation in

covery, to carry down to a friend 
who loved her aa she loved her 
own life? 

The lady, said he , will do very 
well, if she will resolve upon it

The doctor is entirely of this 
opinion; and has ordered nothing 
for you, hut weak Jellies and in- 
nocent cordials, lest you should 
starve yourself. And let me tell 
you, madam, that so much watch- 
ing, BO little nourishment, andso

stomach. J do what 1 can: and

cusable if I did not.

make physic unnecessary in your 
case. And that is , " go to rest at 
ten at ni^ht. Kise not till seven in 
the morning. Let your breakfast 
be water-grur.l , or milk pottage, 
or weak broths: your dinner any 
thin^ you like, so you will but eat : 
a disn of tea, with milk in the after- 
noon; and sago for your supper: 
and, my life for yours, this diet, 
and a month's country air, will set 
youup." 

We were much pleased with the 
worthy gentleman's disinterested 
regimen: and she said, referring 
to ner nurse (who vouched for her). 
Pray, Mr. Hickman, let Miss Howe 
know the good hands I am in; and 
as to the kind charge of the gen- 
tleman, assure her, that all I pro- 
mised to her, in the longest of my 
two last letters , on the subject of 
my health, I do and will, to the 
utmost of my power, observe. I 
have engaged, sir, (to Mr. God- 
dard) I have engaged, sir, (to me) 
to Miss Howe, to avoid all wilful 
neglects. It would be an un- 
pardonable fault , and very ill be- 
come the character I would be 
glad to deserve , or the temper of 
mind I wish my friends hereafter 
to think me mistress of, if I did 
not. 

Mr. Hickman and I went after- 
wards to a neighbouring coflFee- 
bouse; and he gave me some ac- 
count of your behaviour at the ball 
on Monday night, and of your 
treatment of him in the conference 
he had with you before that ; which 
he represented in a more favour- 
able light than you had done 
roiirseii: and jet he gave his sen- 



timents of you with great free- 
dom , but with the politeness of a 
gentleman. 

He told mehow very determined 
the lady was against marrying 
you; that she had, early this 
morning, set herself to write a 
letter to Miss Howe , in answer to 
one he brought her, which he was 
to call for at twelve , it being al- 
most finished before he saw her 
at breakfast; and that at three 
he proposed to set out on his re- 
turn. 

He told me that Miss Howe, and 
her mother and himself, were to 
begin their little journey for the 
Isle of Wight on Monday next: 
but that he must make the most 
favourable representation of Miss 
Harlowe's bad health, or they 
should have a very uneasy ab- 
sence. He expressed the pleasure 
he had in finding the lady in such 
good hands. He proposed to call 
on Dr. H. to take his opinion whe- 
ther it were likely she would re- 
cover ; and hoped he should find it 
favourable. 

As he was resolved to make the 
best of the matter, and as the lady 
had refused to accept of money 
offered by Mr. Hickman, I said 
nothing of her parting with her 
clothes. I thought it would serve 
no other end to mention it, but to 
shock Miss Howe: for it has such 
a sound with it, that a woman of 
her rank and fortune should be so 
reduced, that I cannot myself 
think of it with patience; nor 
know I but one man in the world 
who can.

raciseneases, which the confident,

imagine the world made for us, 
and for us only. 

Thus as to useful knowledge, 
while others go to the bottom, we 
only skim the surface; are de- 
spised by people of solid sense, of 
true honour, and superior talents; 
and shutting our eyes, move round 
and round (like so many blind 
mill-horses) in one narrow circle, 
while we imagine we have all the 
world to range in. 

* * * 

I threw myself in Mr. Hick- 
man's way, on his return irom the 
lady. 

He was excessively moved at 
taking leave of her ; being afraid, 
as he said to me (though he would 
not tell her so) that he should 
never see her again. She charged 
him to represent every thing to 
Miss Howe in the most favourable 
light that the truth would bear. 

He told me of a tender passage 
at parting; which was, that having 
saluted her at her closet- door, he 
could not help once more taking 
the same liberty, in a more fer- 
vent manner, at the stairs-head, 
whither she accompanied him; 
and this in the thought, that it 
was the last time he should ever 
have that honour; and offering to 
apologize for his freedom (for he 
had pressed her to his heart with 
a vehemence, that he could neither 
account for nor resist) — "Excuse 
you, Mr. Hickman! that I will: 
you are my brother and my friend : 
and to shew you, that the good 
man who is to be happy with my 
beloved Miss Howe, is very dear 
to me, yoM shall carry to her this 



token of my love" [offering her 
sweet face to his salute, and 
pressing his hand between hers] : 
*And perhaps her love of me will 
make it more agreeable to her, 
than her punctilio would other- 
wise allow it to be: and tell her, 
said she, dropping on one knee, 
with clasped hands, and uplifted 
eyes, that in this posture you see 
me, in the last moment of our 
parting, begging a blessing upon 
you both, and uiat you may be 
the delight and comfort of each 
other for many, very many happy 
years ! " 

Tears, said he, fell from my 
eyes : I even sobbed with mingled 
joy and sorrow: and she retreat- 
ing as soon as I raised her, I went 
down stairs highly dissatisfied 
with myself for going ; yet unable 
to stay; my eyes hxed the con- 
trary way to my feet, as long as I 
could behold the skirts of her rai- 
ment. 

I went into the back-shop, con- 
tinued the worthy man, and re- 
commended the angelic lady to 
the best care of Mrs. Smith; and, 
when I was in the street, cast my 
eye up at her window: there, for 
the last time, I doubt, said he, that 
I shall ever behold her, I saw her; 
and she waved her charming hand 
to me, and with such a look of 
smiling goodness, and mingled 
concern, as I cannot describe. 

Pr'ytheetellme, thou vile Love- 
lace, if thou hast not a notion, 
even from these jejune de- 
scriptions of mine, that there must 
be a more exalted pleasure in in- 
tellectual friendship, than ever

There must be still a great deal

THE HISTORY OF 



But if you are displeased with ; 
me for the freedoms I took so long ' 
ago as you mention, I am afraid, I 
ifyou Knew what passed upon an 
application I made to your sister 
very lately (in hopes to procure 
you the absolution your heart is 
so much set upon) that you would 
be still more concerned. But they 
have been even with me — but I 
must not tell you all. I hope, 
however, that these unforgivers 
[my motherV among them] were 
always good, dutS'ul, passive 
children to their parents. 

Once more forgive me. I owned 
I was too warm. But I have no 
example to the contrary, but from 
you: and the treatment you meet 
with is very little encouragement 
to me to endeavour to imitate you 
in your dutiful meekness. 

You leave it to me to give a ne- 
gative to the hopes of the noble 
family, whose only disgrace is, 
that so very vile a man is so nearly 
related to them. But yet — alas ! 
my dear, I am so fearful of con- 
sequences, so selfishly fearful, if 
this negative must be given — I 
don't ^ow what I should say — 
but give me leave to suspend, 
however, this negative, till 1 hear 
from you again. 

This earnest courtship of you 
into their splendid family is so 
very honourable to you — they so 
justly admire you — you must 
have had such a noble triumph over 
the base man — He is so much 
in earnest — the world knows so 
much of the unhappy affair — you 
may do still so much good — your 
will is so inviolate — your rela- 



tions are so implacable — think 
dear, and re-think. 

And let me leave you to do so, 
while I give you the occasion of 
the flutter I mentioned at the be- 
ginning of this letter; in the con- 
clusion of which you will find tiie 
obligation I have consented td lAy 
myself under, to refer this impor- 
tant point once more to yV)ur dis- 
cussion, before I give in your 
name, the negative that cannot, 
when given, be with honour to 
yourself repented of or recalled. 

Know then, my dear, that I 
accompanied my mother to Co- 
lonel Ambrose's, on the occasion I 
mentioned to you in my former. 
Many ladies and gentlemen were 
there whom you know; parti- 
cularly Miss Kitty D'Oily, Miss 
Lloyd, Miss Biddy d'OUyffe, Miss 
Biddulph, and their respective 
admirers with the colonel's two 
nieces: fine women both; besides 
many whom you know nof^ for 
they were strangers to me but by 
name. A splendid company, and 
all pleased with one another, till 
Colonel Ambrose introduced one, 
who, the moment he was brought 
into the great hall, set the whole 
assembly into a kind of agita- 
tion. 

It was your villain. 

I thought I should have sunk as 
soon as 1 set my eyes upon him. 
My mother was also affected; and, 
coming to me, Nancy, whispered 
she, can you bear tiie sight of 
that wretch without too mucn emo- 
tion? — If not, withdraw into the 
next apartment. 

I could not remove. Every bo-

either saw me not, or would not 
yet see me; and addressing him- 
self to my mother, taking her un- 
willing hand, with au air of high 
asBurauce, 1 am glad to see you 
here, madam, 1 hope MissHowe 
is well. I have reason to complain 

freatly of her: but hope to owe to 
er the highest obtigatiou thatcan 
be laid on man. 

My daughter, air, is accnstjimed 
to be too warm and too zealous in 
her friendships for either my tran- 
quillity, or her own. 

There had indeed been some 
late occasion given for mutual 
displeasure between my mother 
and me: but I think she might 
have spared this to iiin ; though 
nobody heard it I believe but the 
person to whom it was spoken, and 
the lady who told it me; for my 
mother spoke it low. 

We are not wholly, madam, to 
live for ourselves, said the vile 
hypocrite; itianot every one wl\'s 
has a soul capa-toVe o^ 'ineiv&^vi&-.

and what a. heart miiBt that be, 
■which can, be insensible to the in- 
terests of a Buffering frieod? 

This senllment from Mi. Love- 
lace's mouth! said my mother — 
forgireme, sir; hut you can have 
no end, Hurely, in eudeavouring 
to make me think , as well of you 
as some innocent creatures l^ve 
thought ofrou, totheircoEt. 

She would have flung from him. 
But, detaining her hand — Leas 
severe, dear madam, said he, be 
less severe in f/us place, I beseech 
you. You will allow, that a very 
faulty person may see his errors; 
and when he does, and owns them, 
and repents, should he not be 
treated mercifully? 

Your air, sir, seems not to be 
that of a penitent. But the place 
may as properly excuse this sub- 
ject, as what you call my se- 
verity. 

But dearest madam, permit me 
to »ay , that I hope for your inter- 
est with your charming daughter 
{was his sycophant word) to have 
it put in my power to convince all 
the world, tliat there never was a 
truer penitent. And why, why

Miss Arabella Harlowe, exeusa

not aak, if Miss Howe be here? 

She would not have been here, 
replied my mother,had she known 
whom she had been to see.

Biddulph, shall begin from me to

from some, that 1 would not hear

I was going out of the assembly 
in great diaorder. " 

How kind this is,8aid thevrretch 
and, ready to follow me, opened 
the door for me. 

I turned back upon this; and 
notknowing what Idtd, snapped 
my fan just in his face, aa be 
turned short upon me; and the 
powder flew from bis hair. 

Every body seemed as much 
pleased, aa I was vexed. 

He turned to Mr. Hickman, 



n; Mr. Hickman, you will be 
one of the happiest men in the 
world, because you are a good 
man, and will do nothing to pro- 
voke thia passionate lady; and 
because she has too much good 
sense to be provoked without rea- 
son : but else the lord have mercy 
upon you! 

This man, this Mr. Hickman, 
my deaij is too meek far a man. 



Indeed he is. — But my patient 
mother twits me, that her 
sionate daughter ought to 
him Ihe belfer for that. But me«k 
men abroad ore not always meek 
men at home. I have observed 
that in more instances than 
and if they tceie, I should not, I 
verily think, like them the better 
for being so. 

He then turned to mr mot 
resolved to be even with her . _ . 
Where, good madam, could Mies 
Howe get all this spirit? 

Tbe company around smiled, 
for I need not t£ll you , that my 
mother'shighspiritednessis prett 
well known; and she, sadly rezec , 
said, Sir, yon treat me, as you do 
the rest ot the world — but — 

I beg pardon, madam, inter* 
rupted he: I might have spared 
my question — and instantly (I re- 
tiring to the other end of the hall) 
be turned to MissPlayford; What 
would I give, madam, to liearyou

He then, as if nothing bad hap-

withberaudMissD'Ollyffe,! ,

hands, with such airs of genteel

little to look round, and see how 
pleased half tbe giddy fools of our

ing bis notorious wicked character. 
To this it is, that such vile fellows

I have no patience with such a

To be sure he would behave in the

Bee me ebnn him )u I did) that the 
poet's observation waa too true, 
that the generality' of ladies were 
- ' B in Ihar Jiearls , or they could 
be so much taken with a man 
who had 90 DotoriouE a, character. 

I told him, the reflection both of 
the poet and applier waa mnch 
too general , and made with more 
ill-aatare than good manners. 

When the wretch saw bow in- 
dustriously I avoided hira (ahift- 
ing from one part of the hall to 
another) he atlast boldly Btept up 
to me.asmymotherandMr.Uick- 
man were taUdng to me; and thus 
before them accosted me : 

I beg your pardon, madam; but 
by your motner's leave, I must 
Jiave a few moments' conversation 
with you, either here, or at your 
own house; and I beg you will 
give me the opportunity. 

Nancy, said my mother, hear 
what he has to say to" you. In 
nypreaence youmay: and better 
n the adjoining apartment', if '' 
must be. than to come to you 

1 retired to one comer of the 
ball, my mother following me, and 
be, tating Mr. Hickman under 
the arm. Following her — Well, 

ir, said I, what have you to aay? 

- Tell me heie. 
I have been telling Mr. Hick- 

aaii, said he, how much I am con- ' 
cemed for the injuries Ihave done 
to the most excellent woman in 
the world: and yet, that she ob~ 
tained such a glorious triumph 
over me the last time I had the 
honour to see her, aa, with my 
peaitence, ought to have abated 



t: 



her former resentments : but that 
1 will , with all my sonl , en ter into 
to obtain her for- 
giveoesa of me. My cousins Mon- 
tague have told you this. Lady 
Betty and Lady Sarah, and my 

are engaged for 
hononr. I know your power 

dear creature. My couains 

me, you gave them hopes you 

would use it ia my behalf. My 

Lord M. and his two sisters, are 

of it 

her before now: I hope yoi . _. 

And will you be so goodaa to tell 

if I may have any hopes? 

■I must speak on this subject, 

me tell you, that you have 

broken her heart. Youknownot 

the value of the lady you havein- 

jured. You deserve her not. And 

she despises you, as she ought. 

DeacMisBliowe,minglenotpa8- 

jn with denunciations so severe^ 
I must know my fate. I will go 
, if I find her ab- 
solutely irreconcileable. But I 
hope she will give me leave to at- 
tend upon her, to know my doom 
from her own mouth. 

It would be death immediate for 
her to see you. And what must 
yo\i be , to be able to look her ia 
the face? 

1 then reproached him (with 
vehemence enough you may be- 
lieve] on his baaeueas, and the 
evila he bad made you suffer: the 
distress he had reduced you to ^all 
your friends made your enemies: 
the vile house he had carried you 
to: hinted at his villainous arts; 
the dreadful arrest: and told Mm 



hAvehira. 

He vindicated not any p!irt of 
hHCOiidact,but that of'theitrrest; 
and M) Botemnly protested hU eor- 
lotr forhia usage of you, accusiog 
himself in the freest manner , and 
by deserved appellations, that I 
promieed to lay before you this 
part of our conrerefLtion, And 
nawyoDhaveit. 

My mother, as well aa Mr. Hick- 
man, believes, from what passed 
•D this occasion, that he istoucbed 
in oonscience for the wrongs he 
Ins done you: but, by his whole 
behaviour, I must own, it seems to 
EU tiiat nothing caa touch him 
fa half an hour together. Yet I 
bftieno doubt, that he would wil- 
Hp^y manv yon: and it piijues 
hia pride, I conld see, that he 
■faoild be denied; as it did mine, 
that Huch a wretcli had dared to 
(hint it in hia poiver ta have Bucb 
ft ngmaa whenever he pleased; 
i that it must be accounted a 
soenston, and matter of obli- 
1 (by all his own family at 
4 that he would vouchsafe to 
i& of marriage. 
F-Sov, my dear, you have before 
- " ■easori why 1 suspend the 
neeative to the ladies of 
bfanily. My mother, Miss Lloyd, 
id llise BJddulph , who were in- 
Kjtitive after the subject of our 
';ed conversation, and whose 

Mity I thought it was right, in 

■ome degree, to gratify (especially 
as tiioie young ladies are of oar 
Klect acquaintance), are all of 
I apinion that you should be hie. 



HARLOWE. 23 

Vou will let Mr. Hickman koow 
your whole mind; and when he 
acquaints me with it, 1 will tell 
yon all my own. 

Meantime, may the newB he 
will bring me of the state of your 
health, be favourable ! prays, with 
the utmost fervency.

LETTER Vn. 



Aftbr I have thankfiiily ac- 
knowledged your fevour in send- 
ing Mr. Hickman to visit me 
before yon .set out upon your in- 
tended journey, Imust chide y( 



it is if it would not admit of that 
cementing freedom) for suspending 
the decisive negative, which, upon 
sueh full dehberatioa, I had en- 
treated yon to give to Mr. Love- 
lace's relations. 

I am sorry that I am obliged to 
repeat to you, my dear, whoKnow 
me BO well, that, were I sure 1 
should live many years, I would 
not have Mr. Lovelace ; much less 
can I think of him, as it is pro- 



fame, yetlnever thought it right 
to give more than a secuiul place 
to the world's opinion. T;\s.c ti«X- 
lengesmade to Mi-^^-^^a-eai^t - 



my reputation: and what ail- 
vantage would it be to me, were il 
retrieTable, and were I to live 
long, if Icould not acquit myself 
to Msedf* 

Ilaving in mj former said eo 
much on the ficedoma you have 
taken with nij friends , 1 shall say 
the less now; but i/our hint, tbat 
Honiething else has newly passed 
between some of tbem and you, 
givea me great concern, and that 
well for my own sake, as for 
!rs; since it must necessarily in - 
. . we tliem against me. 1 wish, 
my dear, tbat I had been left to 

very interesting to myself. But 
since what is done cttnnot be 
helped, I mnat abide the conae- 

Juences: yet I dread, more Ikon 
p.fare, what may bo my sister's 
answer, if an answer will be at all 
vouchsafed. 

Will yoa give me leave, my 
dear, to close this sabject with one 
remark? — Itisthis; thatmy be- 
loved friend, in points where ber 
own laudable zeal la concerned, 
: bsa ever seemed more ready to fly 
from the rebuke, than irom the 
fault. If you will eicnse this free- 
dom , I will acknowledge thus far 
in favour of your way of thinking ; 
as to the conduct of some parents 
in these nice cases, th&tindiscreel 
opposition does frequently as 
muchmischief as^iVW^love. 

As to the invitation you a-tb so 
kind as to give me, to remove 

■ 'ately into your neighbour- 
-^ J hare told Mr. J^ckman 



tbat 1 will cousider of it; but be- 
lieve , if you will be so good as ta 
excuse me, that [ shall not accept ' 
of it, even should I be able to ri 
move. I will give you my reaaoi 
for declining it ; and so 1 oughts . 
when both my love and my grati- ' 
tude, would make a visit now-and' 
then from mv dear Miss Howe tbe 
most consolatory thing i 
world to me. 

You must know then, thatthis 
greattown, wickedasitis, wants 
□ot opportunities of being better; 
having daily prayers at several 
churches in it ; and 1 am desirous^ 
as my strength will permit, to eiii>5 
brace those opportuwitioB. Tte, 
method 1 have proposed to myself^ 
(and was beginnmg to practae 
when that cruel arrest deprived 
me both of Jreedom and streu^h) 
is this: wben I was disposeuto 
gentle exercise , 1 took a chai: tO' 
St. Duustan's church in Fleet- 
Street, where are prayers at se 



take chair) to Lincoln' 
chapel, where at eleven i 
morning, and at five in the sfter-' 
noon, are the same desirable op-.- 
portunit.ies ; and at other tiixefl to 
go no further than Covent Gudea : 
church, where are early mcming-i 
pr^ era likewise. 

This method pursued, I loobti 
not, will greatly help, as it hu al- 
ready done, to calm my distarbecl'i 
thoughts, and to bring met) tliab 
perfect resignatiou after which I- 
aspire: for Imust own, mydea^. 
tbat sometimes still my erieri and 
my reflections are l«o heaty ft 



■me; and all tlie aid I can draw 
from religimis iliUks ia hardly auffi- 
cient to support loy staggering 
leason. I am avery young crea- 
ture, jon know, my dear, to be 
left to my own conduct in such 
(UrcumBtaucca as I am in. 

Another reason why I choose 
not to go down into j 
bourhood , is , the displ 
might arise , on my ai 
tween your molher and you. 

Ifindeedyouwereactually 
lied, and the worthy man (who 
wonld then have a title to all your 
r^ard] were earnestly desirons 
of my near ncighhourhood , 1 
know not what I might do: for 
although I might not perhaps in- 
tend to give up my other impor- 
tant reasona at the Ihne I should 
make yon a congratulatory visit, 
— ' ■ might not know how to deny 
llf the pleasure of continning 
you when there. 

I send you Inclosed the copy of 
t^ letter to mj sister. I hope it 
mil be thoi^ht to he written with 
a true penitent spirit; for indeed 
it is. 1 desire that you will nol 
think 1 Btoop too low in it; aince 
there can be no such thing as thai 
in acbild toparentawhomshehas 
nnbappily offended. 

But if still (perhaps more dis~ 
eosted than before at your free- 
aom with them) they should pase 
it by with the coutempt of silence 
(fori have not yet been favoured 
with an answer) I must lean ' 
think it right in them to do 
•apeeiatly as It is my first direct 
application : for I have often can-

But if my letter should be an-

will make me loth to communicate 
it to so warm a friend — you must 
not, my dear, take upon you to 
censure my relations; but allow , 
for them, aa they know not what I 
have suffered; as being filled with 
j'ltrt resentments against me fjiw' 
to them, if they MiVit them just;) 
and as not being able to judge of 
the reality of my penitence. 

And after all, what can they do 
for me? — Tbey_ can only pily 
me: and what will that do, out 
augment their own 'jn'ef'; to wiuch 
at present their reseutinent is an 
alleviation? For can they by their 
pity restore to me my lost reputa-

him fluttering about; abusing ta- 
lents that were given him for ex- 
cellent purposes; taking incon- 
sideration for courage; and 
dancing, fearless of danger, on 
the edge of a precipice ! 

But indeed his threatening to 
see me, most sensibly alarms and 
shocks me. I cannot but hope that 
I never, never more, shall see him 
in this world. 

Since you are so loth, my dear, 
to send the desired negative to the 
ladies of his family, 1 will only 
trouble you to transmit the letter 
I shall inclose for that purpose; 
directed indeed to yourself, be- 
cause it was to you that those 
ladies applied themselves on this 
occasion; but to be sent by you 
to any one of the ladie&, at your 
own choice. 

I commend myself, my dearest 
Miss Howe, to your prayers ; and 
conclude with repeated thanks for 
sending Mr. Hickman to me; and 
with wishes for your health and 
happiness, and for the speedy ce-

LETTER Vin. 

Miss Clarissa Harlowe to Miss Howe. 

[Inclosed in the preceding.] 

Thursday, July 27. 

MT DBABEST MISS HOWB, 

Since you seem loth to acquiesce 
in my determined resolution, signi- 
fied to you as soon as I was able 
to hold a pen, I beg the favour of 
J^oa^ bjtma, or bj any other way 



you think most proper, to acquaint 
the worthy ladies who have ap- 
plied to you in behalf of their re- 
lation, that, although I am in- 
finitely obliged to their generous 
opinion of me, yet I cannot con- 
sent to sanctify^ as I may say, Mr. 
Lovelace's repeated breaches of 
all moral sanctions, and hazard 
mjr future happiness by an union 
with a man, through whose pre- 
meditated injuries, m a long train 
of the basest contrivances, 1 have 
forfeited my temporal hopes. 

He himself, when he reflects 
upon his own actions, must surely 
bear testimony to the justice, as 
well as fitness of my determina- 
tion. The ladies, I dare say, 
would, were they to know the 
whole of my unhappy story. 

Be pleased to acquaint them, 
that I deceive myself, if my reso- 
lution on this head (however un- 
gratefully, and even inhumanly, 
he has treated me) be not owing 
more to principle than passion. 
Nor can I give a stronger proof of 
the truth of this assurance, than 
by declaring that I can and wUL 
forgive him, on this one easy con- 
dition, that Tie will never molest me 
more. 

In whatever way you choose to 
make this declaration, be pleased 
to let my most respectful compli- 
ments to the ladies of that noole 
family, and to my LordM. accom- 

gany it. And do you, my dear, 
elieve that I shall be, to the last 
moment of my life. 

Your ever obliged and 
aflectionate , 

Clarissa hablowe.

three letters of thine to 
tftke notice of,* but am divided in 
017 mind, whether to quarrel nith 
thee, on thy unmercifal re- 
flections, or to thank thee for thy 
acceptable particularity and di- 
ligeoee. Bnt several of my aweot 
dears have I, indeed, inmyti"" 
made to cry and laugh ii 
breatb; nay one side of their 
pretW faces laugh, before the ery 
could go off the other: why may 1 
not, therefore, curae and applaud 
thae in the same moment? So take 
both in one : and what follows, 
it shall rise from my pen. 

Hoif often httve I ingenuously 
confessed my sins against this ex- 
cellent creature? — Yet thou 
never sparest me, although as bad 
ft ntaa as myself. Since then I 
eet so little b^ tny confessions, I 
have a good mind to try to defend 
myself; and that not only from 
ancient and modern story, but 
from common practice; and yet 
avoid repeating any thing 1 have 
■ngeestnl before on my 

1 am in a humour to play the 
fool with my p«n: briefly than, 
from ancient story first: — dost 
Ihou not think, thut I am us much 
entitled to forgiveneaa of Mia 
Hariowe's account, as Virgil' 

Ibero was on Queen Dido's 1 Fo 
l^at an ungrateful varlet was 
■tat vagabond to the hoipilahle 
fanceu who had mllingiy ---

ferred upon him the last favour? 
Stealing away (whence, I sup- 
se the ironical phrase of Tn/s^j 
_ "jun to this day) like a thief — 
prelendedly indeed at tie eom- 
moiid of the gods-, but could 
that be, when the errand he went 
upon was to rob other princes, not 
onl^ of tbeir dominions, bnt of 
their lives? — Yet this fellow is, 
at every word , the pitis ^neas 
with the immortal bard who cele- 
brates him. 

Should Miss Harlowe even 
break her heart (which Heaven 
focbidi) for the usage she has re- 
ceived (to say nothing of her dis- 
appointed pride, to which her 
death would be attributable, more 



And have 1 half the obligation to 
her that iEneaa had to the Queen 
of Carthage? The latter placing 
a confidence, the former none, in 
her man?— Then, whom W.'e have 
I robbed? Whom ehe have I in- 
jured? Her brother's worthless \ 
life I gave him, instead of taking 
any man's; while the Trojan va- 
gabond destroyed his thousands. J 
Why then should it not be the 
pioiis Lovelace, as well as ihepi'is 
.^neaa? For, dost thou think, 
had a conHagratiou happened, 
and had it beeo iu my power, that 
I would not have saved my old 
Ancbises (as he did his from the 
Ilion bonfire) even at the expense 
of my Creiisa, had I had a wife 
of that name? 

But fbr a more modern instance 
in my favour — lia,\e V MaB.4'^\a^

THE msTonv OF 



Queen, as she was called, uaed 
one of her own blood, a aister- 
queen; who threw heraelf into her 
protection from her rebel sub- 
jects ; and whom she detained pri- 
soner eighteen yeara, and at last 
Cttt off her head? Yet do not 
honest Proteatanta pronounce her 
pious too?— And call her particn- 
larlyfiaiV queen? 

As to cummrm practice — who, 
let me ask, that has it in his power 
to gratify a prEtdominftnt passion, 
be it what it will, denies himself 
the gi'atification ? — Leaving it t« 
cooler deliberation (and, if he be 
a great man, to bis flatterers) to 
findareasonfor it afterwards? 

Then, as to the worst part of my 
treatment of this lady ^- bow 
many men are there, who, as well 
aa 1, have sought, by intoxicating 
liquors, first to inehriate, then to 
Bubdue? What signifies what the 
polalians were, when the 

Letme tell thee, upon the whole, 
that neither the Queen of Car- 
■'lage, nor the Queen of Scots, 
omd have thought they had any 
'aBontocomplaiuof cruelty,had 
they been used no worse than I 
have used the queen of my heart ; 
and then do I not aspire with my 
whole soul to repair by marriage? 
K Would the^fW j£neas, thinkeat 
^L tiiou, have done such a piece of 
^1 jnstice by Dido, had she lived? 
^P Come, come, Belford, letpeoplt

to do with the world? 

And now I sit me peaceably 
down to consider thy letters. 

I hope thy pleas in my favonr,* 
when she gave tbee(so generously 
gave thee) for me, my letters, 
were urged with an honest energy. 
But I suspect thee much for bang 
too ready to give up thy client. ' 
Then thou hast such a misgiving 
aspect; an aspect, rather inviting 
rejection, than currying persua- 
sion with it; and art such an he- 
sitating, such an humming and 
hawing caitiHF, that I shall attri- 
bute my failure, if I do fail, ratber 
to the inability and ill looks of mf 
advocate, than to my canse. 
Again, thou art deprived of tbs< 
force men of our cast give toargn- 
mentsl for she won't let toed' 
Kwear! — Art moreover a very 
heavy thoughtless fellow; toler- 
able only at a second rebound; a 
horrid dunce at the imprumplu. 
These, encountering wiui sucb a 
lady, are great die ao vantages. — 
Andstill agreater is thy balancing 
(as thou dost at present) between 
old rakery and new reformation;- 
since this puta thee into the saioo" 
situation with her, as they toldine| 
at Leipeic Martin Luther was in,, 
at the first public dispute whichr 
he held, in defence of his suppoae4.^

consequence, made others, that bs

esttiioujiot, that those words (so 
contrary to common experience) 
were applied to the case of a per-

that carries the most distant al-

the general scope of either, and to 
that case. So once , in a pnlpit , I 
heard ono of the former very vehe- 
mently declare himself to be a 
lienil diiff; when every man, woman, 
and child, were convinced to the 
contrary by his howling. 

I cantellthee, that, if nothing

to set both love and me at defiance. 
Thoucanst not imagine howmuch 
I envy (See, and betYloclor, aiidher

hear are admitted to her presence 
andcoaversation; and wish to be 
the one or the otJier in turn. 

Wherefore, if nothing else will 
do, I will see her. I'll tell thee of 
an admirable etpcdient, just come

Mrs. Lovick, you say, is a good

and I was thought to make a fine 
sleek appearance; my broad rose- 
bound beaver became me mighlili/; 
and I was much admired upon the 
whole by all who saw me.

mythology of the heathen to a

_ iBsest for the books of scripture, 
thou art certainly right in it. But 
'iia Htrange to me , that thoa wert 
ignorant of their beauty, and

renc« them : and how was it poa- 

ile that thou couldest not, for

I'll tell thee a short story, whieh 
I had from my tutor, admonishing 
me against exposing myself by 
^noronlwon(ie;-,when^ should quit 
college, to go to town, or travel. 

" The first time Drydeii's Alex- 
ftodar's Feast fell into his hands, 
he told me, he was prodisiously 
charmed with it; and, having 
never heard any body speak of it 
before, thought, as thou doEt of 
the Bible, that he had made a new 
disoorery. 

"He haatened to an appolnt- 
meitt which he bad with several 
wita (for he was then in town) one 
of whom was a noted critic , who, 
according to him, had more merit 
thiiD good fortune; for all the lit- 
tle nibblers in wit, whose writings 
would not stand the test of 
criticiam, made it, he said, a com- 
mon cause to rmi him down, as men 
would a mad dog. 

"The young gentleman (for 
young he then was) set forth mag- 
nificently ID the praises of that 
inimitable performance; andgave 
himself ^s of lecnndhand merit, 
for finding out its beauties.

you lived till now, or with what 
sort of company have you con- 
versed, young as you are, that 
you have never beforeheard of the 
finest piece in the English lan- 

This story had such an effect 
upon me, who had ever a proud 
heart, and wanted to be thought a 
clever fellow, that, in order to 
avoid the like disgrace, I laid 
down two rules to myself. The 
first, whenever I went into com- 
pany where there were strangei-s, 
to hear every one of them speak, 
before I gave myself liberty to 
prate: theother,if Ifoundany of 
them above my match, to give up 
all title to new discoveries, con- 
tenting myself to praise whatthey 
praised, as beauties familiar to 
me, though I had never heard of 
them before. And so, by degrees, 
I got Ibe reputation of a wit my- 
self: aod when I threw off all 
restraint, and books, and learned 
conversation, and fell in with some 
of our brethren who are now 
wandering in Erebus, and with 
such others as Helton, Mowbray, 
'i'ourville, and thyself, I set up on 
my own stock; and like what we 
have been told of Sir Kichard , in 
his latter days, valued myself on 
beingtheEmperoroftbecompauy: 
for, having fathomed the depth of 
them all, and afraid of no rival but 
thee, whom also I had got a little

in the height ofpftssion or reaent-

which micht be followed by a

the spirits. 

So we read of a famous French

It concerns me, however, not a

known among the ^fiji/ian(iof both

There never, surely, mas such nil 
odd little soul as this. — Not to 
keep her own secret, when the 
revealing of it could answer no 
possible good end ; and when she 
wants not (one would think) to 
raise to herself either pity or 
friends, or to me enemies, by the 
proclamation ! — Why, Jack, must 
not all her own aex laugh in their

tiie whole world would either he a

Howe (as much as she hates me) 
kept her word with my cousins on 
their visit to her, aud wiib me at 
the Colonel's to endeavour to per- 
suade her Iriend to make up all 
matters by matrimony ; which, no 
doubt, is the beat, nay, the only 
method she can take, for her own 
honour, and that of her family. 

I had once thought of revenging 
myself on that vLxeu; and, parti- 
cularly, aa thou may'at** re- 
member, had planned something 
to this purpose on the journey she 
is going to take, which had been 
talked of some time. But I think

she is uot a little touched at times? 
I am afraid she is, A little spieo: 
of that insanity, I doubt, rum

of my operations. Her contempt 
of hfe; her proclamations; hec

up a death's head, and an hour-

I be old penitent fornicator , a

What figures would a couple of 
brocaded or laced -waist coated 
toupets make with their sour 
screwed up half-cocked faces, and 
more than half-shut eyes, in a 
kneeliug attitude, recapitulating 
their respective rogueries? This 
scheme, were we only to make 
trial of it, and return afterwards 
to our old ways, might serve to 
better purpose by far, than Hor- 
ner's in the Country Wife, to bring 
the pretty girls to ub.

that would suit us, when met in

our dismal notes together. This

Friday night, July 18, 

I WILL now, my dearest fnemdi 
write to you all mj mind , withow 
reserve, on your resolution not tr™ 
have this vilest of men. Yougwi^ 
me, in yours of Sunday the 23l^ 
reasons so worthy of the pun 
mind of my Clariasa, in support 
of this your reaolntion. that no-^ 
thing hut self-love, lest 1 sbouli 
lose my ever- ami able friend, coali 
have prevailed npon me to wtidi 
you to alter it. Indeed , I thought 
it was impossible there could 0$ 
(however Qesirable)ao noble I 
stance given by any of our se , 
a passion conciuercd, when tnera 
were so many mducementa to give 
way to it And therefore I wa» 
willing to urge you once mt 
_ jij^j, j^gj indignation. 



^^Vnd to be prQvaJled upon bj the 
^"wUeitations of /lis frieuds, before 
yoo carried jour reaentinenta to 
M great a height, that it would 
be more difficult for you , and less 
toyoor honour, to comply, than 
if you had compbed at firsL 

But now, my dear, that I 

you fixed in your noble resolution: 

and that it ta impoiiaible for your 

^^•nre mind to join Itaelf with that 

^■WM) perjured a miscreant; I 

^^Kfatalate yon most heartily npoii 

^HRl and beg your pardon for but 

^VieeiDingtodoubt, thatrtmrjand 

* practice were not the same thing 

irith my beloved Clariaaa. 

I have only one thing that sad 
deaa my heart on this occasion; 
and that ie the bad state of bealtli 
Mr. Hickman (unwillingly) owns 
you are in. Hitherto you have 
well observed the doctrine yon al- 
ways laid down to me. That a 
oeoBOred person should first seek 
toibejuatified to/iicsei/', andgive 
but « 4Bcond place to the world's 

X' lion of her; and, ia all cases 
re the two could not be recon- 
ciled, have preferred the first to 
\})ftLa^i; and are, of consequence, 
wall joatlfied to your own heart as 
well as to your Anna Howe. Let 
ma therefore bosoecit you to en- 
deavoart by all poasiole means, 
to veeover your health and spirits: 
K and this, as what, if it emt be 
L ffltected , will crowu the work, 
k wul shew the world, that you were 
K indeed got above the base wretch ;

well by yont ciample , as by your 
precepts. 

For heaven's sake, then, for 
the world's sake, for tho honour 
ofoursex, and form^ sake, ouce 
more 1 beseech you, try to over- 
come this shock: and if you can 
overcome it, 1 shall then be as 
happy as 1 wish to be ; for 1 can- 
not, indeed 1 cannot, think of 
parting with you, for many, many 

The reasons you give for dis- 
couraging my wishes to have you 
that 



mind is fully settled , as (nc 
are so abaolutely dotermiued Ju it, 
witii regard to this wretch) 1 hope 
it will soon be, I shall expect yon 
with us, or near ua; and then you 
shall chalk out every path that 1 
will set my foot in ; nor will I turn 
iiaide either to the right hand or 
to the left. 

You wish I had not mediated 
for you to your friends. I wish so 
too; because my mediation was 
ineffectual' because it may give 
oengrouna for the malice of some 
of them to work upon; and be- 
cause you are angry with me for 
doing so. But how, as X said in 
my former, could 1 sit down in 
quiet wbou I knew how uneasy 
tneir implacableness made you? 
— But 1 will tear myself from the 
subject; for 1 eee I shall be warm 
again — and displease you — and 
there is not one thing in the world 
that I would do, however agree- 
able to myself, if 1 thought 
would disoblige you:, u

that I wonld omit to do , if I knew 
it would give yon pleasure. And 
indeed, my dear half -severe friend, 
I will try if I cannot avoid the fault 
- 1 willingly as I would the rehike. 
For tbia reason , I forbear say- 
g aaythingon so nice a subject 
as your letter to your sister. It 
' be right, because you think 
— and if it ba taken 
ought, that will shew you that it 
is. But if it begets insults and r~ 
vilincB, as it is but too likely - 
I find you don't intend to let n

ment of your relations, 
have often told you, I cannot 
imitate you in this. It is not a 
necessary point of belief with me, 
that all people in years are Ihere- 
forewiBB; or tha.t all young people 
are therefure rash and headstrong : 
it may be generally the case, as 
far as I know : and possibly it may 
be so in the case ofViy mother and 
ftergbl: but I will venture to say, 
\ that it has not yet appeared to be 
so between the principals of Har- 
lowe Place, and their second 
daughter. 

You are for excusing them 

beforehand for their eapected 

cruelly, aanot knowing what you 

have suffered, nor how ill you are: 

they have heard of the former.and 

are not sorry for it ; of the latter, 

they have been lold, and / have 

I most reason to know how they 

H have taken it — but I shall be far 

I bom avoiding the fault, and as 



BUrely shall incur the rebuke, if I 
say any more upon this subject. I 
will therefore only add at present, 
that your reasonings ia their be- 
half shew jou to be ail excellence : 
their returns to you, that they are 
all — do, my dear, let me end with 
a tittle bit of spitefiil justice — but 
you won't, I know — so 1 have 
done, quite done, however re- 
luctantly: yet if you think of the 
word I would have said, don't 
doubt the justice of it, and fill up 
the blank with it. 

You intimate, that were I 
actually married, and Mr. Hick- 
man to desire it, you would think 
of obliging me with a, visit on the 
occasion', and that perhaps when 
with me, it would be difficult for 
you to remove far from me. 

Lord , my dear, what a stresa do 
you seem to lay upon Mr. Hick- 
man's desiring it ! — To he sure be 
does, and would of all things de> 
sire to have you near us, and vnlh 
us, if we might bo so favoured - 
policy, as well as veneration fbr 
ymi, would undoubtedly make the 
man,if n(itafool,rZf9!Ve this. Bnt 
let me tell you, that if Mr. Hi 
man, after marriage, should pre- 
tend to dispute with me my friend- 
ships, as 1 hope I am not quite a 
fool, I should let him know how 
far his own quiet was concerned in. 
such an impertinence; especially 
if they were aueh friendships ai 
were contracted before I knew him. 

I know I always differed frtim 




r 



dear, from a persoji of your BCDse 
and judgment, are no nnj advan- 
tageouB to ua; inasmucli aa they 
jiutify that assuming sex iu their 
insolence; when hardly one out 
of len of them, their opportuni- 
tiee considered, deserres any pre- 
rogative at all. Look through all 
the faraiiies we know; and we 
shall not find one-third of theun 
have half the sense of their wives. 
And yet these are to be vested 
with prerogatives! And a woman 
of twice their sense has nothiuK to 
do bat hear, tremble, and oBey 

— and for consciaiCg-aabB too, I 
warrant I 

But Mr. Hickman and I may 
perhaps have a little diacourae 
npontbesesort of subjects, before 
I suffer him to talk of the day: 
and then I shall let him know 
what he has to trust to ; as be will 
me, if he be a sincere man, what 
he pretends to expect from me. 
Bntletme tell yon, my dear, that 
it is more in your power, than per- 
haps you think it, to hasten the 
dsyso much pressed for by my mo- 
ther, as weir as wished for by you 

— for the very day that you caii 
KBsure me that yon are in a toler- 
able state of health, and have dis- 
charged yonr doclor and apothe- 
cary, at their own motions, on

letter of juat reprobation of the 
greatest profligate in the king-

done amiss that I transcribe some 
of the paragraphs of yourletterof

iiH you at first intended should be 

You are, it seems (and that too 
much for your health) emp!o;yed 
in writing: I hope it is in penning 
down the particulars of your tra- 
gical story. And my mother has 
put me in mind to press vou. to it, 
with a view, that one dav, if it 
might be published under feigned 
names, it would be of asmucnuse 
as honour to the sei. My mother 
says, she cannot help admiring 
you for the propriety of your re- 
sentment in your refusal of the 
wretch; and she would be ex- 
tremely glad to have her advice 
of penniug your sad story com- 
plied with. And then, she says, 
your noble conduct throughout 
your trials and calamities will 
afford not only a shining exaniplo 
to our sex, but at the same time 
(those calamities befalling ancR 
a person) a fearful wammg to 
the inconsiderate young creatures 

On Monday we shall set out on 
our Journey; and I hope to be 
back in a fortnight, and on my 
return will have one pull more 
with my mother for a London 
journey r and, if the pretence must

I HiTE not been wanting to use 
nil my interest with my beloved 
friend, to induce her to forgive 
and be reconciled to your cousin 
(tlioagh he has eo ill deserved it)i 
iind have even repfatediaj earnest 
advice to her on this head. This 
repetition, and the waiting for her 
answer, having taken up time, 
have been the cause that I could 
not sooner do myself the honour 
of writing to yon on this subject. 

Yon will see by the inclosed, her

for the justice of her determina-

I but too much reason to appre- 
a well hy that, as by the 
report of a gentleman just come 
from her, that she is in such a de- 
cliningwaya^ to her health, that 
her thougnts are very differently 
employed than ou a continuance 

The inclosed letter she thought 
fit to send to me unsealed, that 
after I had penised it, I mleht for- 
ward it to you ; aiid this is the rea- 



son it is superscribed by myself, 
and sealed with my seal. It is 
very full and peremptory; but as 
she bad been pleased, in a letter 
to me, dated the 23d instant (aa 
soon as she could hold a pen) t» 
give inemore ample reasons why- 
she could not comply with your 
(resBiug requests, as well as mine, 
will transcribe some of tiie pas- 
sages in that letter, which v '" 
give one of the wickedest mOD 
the world (if he sees them) reat 
to think himself one of the most 
unhappy, in the loss of so incom- 
parable a wife as he might have

an hopeful way, as to his health. 
He desires his duty to you. He is 
very low and weak, and so am I. 
But this is tbe first time that 1 
have been able, for several days 
past, to sit up to write, or I would 
not have been so long silent. 

Your letter to your sister is re- 
ceived and answered. You have 
the answer by this time, Isuppose. 
1 wish it may be to your satisfac- 
tion ; but am afraid it will not ; for, 
by Betty Barnes, I find they were 
in a great ferment on receiving 
^ours, and much divided whether 
It should be answered or not. 
They will not yet believe that you 
are so ill, as (to my infinite con- 
cern) I find you are. What passed 
between Miss Harlowe and Miss 
Howe, has been, as I feared it 
would be, an aggravation. 

1 shewed Betty two or three 
passages in your letter to me ; and 
she seemed moved, and said, she 
would report them favourably, 
and would procure me a visitfrom 
Miss Harlowe, if I would premise 
to shew the same to her. But 1 
have heard no more of that. 

Motbinks,! am sorry you refuse 
the wicked man: But doubt not, 
nevertheless, that your motives 
for doing so are more commend- 
able than my wishes that yoa 
would not. But as you would.be 
resolved, as I maj aa.'j , "MiNiie , 'A

yon gave way to aueh a thought; 
and as I have so much interest in 
yonr recovery; I cannot forbear 
shewing this ree; 

' ' ask you , S you cannot get 
your just reaentraent? — 
But I dare say no more on this 
sabject. 

What a dreadful thing indeed 
was it for my dearest tender young 
lady to be arrested in the streets 
fifLondonI — How does my heart 
go over again for you, what yours 
mnat have suffered at that time! 
— Yet this, to such a mind as 
yours, must be light, compared 
to what you had suffered before. 

my dearest Miss Clary, bow 
shall we know what to pray for, 
when we pray, but that (Voif,? will 
may be dnne, and that we may be 
resiffaed to ill — When at nine 
years old, and afterwards at 
eleven, you had adaogerous fever, 
how incessantly did we all grieve, 
and pray, and put up our vows to 
the throne of grace for your re- 
covery! — For all our lives were 
bound up in your life — yet iidm', 
my dear, as it has proved (espe- 
cially if we are soon to lose yon) 
what ftmuchmoredeBirableeveut, 
both for you and for us, would 
it have been, had we then lost 
you. 

A sad thing to say ! but as it is 
in pure love to yon that I say it, 
and in full conviction that we are 
not always fit to be our own 
choosers, I hope it may be ex- 
cusable: and the rather, as the 
same reflection will naturally lead 
both you and me to acquiesce 
ujider the present dispensation:

greatest good may, for ought

1 am glad yon are with such

But to what purpose? — Don't 
send it — I charge you, don't — 
I dare not see it — 

Yet — 

But, alas! — 

forgive the almost distracted 
mother! You can. 

You know how to allow for all 
this. — So I will let it go. — I will 
not write over again this part of 
my letter. 

But I choose not to know more 
of her, than is communicated to 
us all — no more than I dare own 
I have seen — and what some of 
them may rather communicate to 
me , than receive from me : and 
this for the sake of my outward 
quiet! Although my inward peace 
suffers more and more by the com- 
pelled reserve. 

* * * 

1 was forced to break off. But 
I will now try to conclude my long 
letter. 

I am sorry you are ill. But if 
you were well, I could not, for 
your own sake, wish you to go up, 
as Betty tells us you long to do. 
If you went, nothing would be 
minded that came from you. As 
they already think you too partial 
in her favour, your going up would 
confirm it, and do yourself preju- 
dice, and her no good. And as 
every body values you here, I ad- 
vise you not to interest yourself 
too warmly in her favour, espe- 
cially before my Bella's Betty , till 
I can let you know a proper time. 
Yet to forbid you to love the dear 
naughty creature, who can? O 
my Norton I you must love her I — 
And so must I J 



I send you five guineas-, to help 
you in your present illness, and 
your son's; for it must have lain 
heavy upon you. What a sad, 
sad thing, my dear good woman, 
that all your pains, and all my 
pains, for eighteen or nineteen 
years together, have, in so few 
mouths, been rendered thus de- 
plorably vain! Yet I must be al- 
ways your friend, and pity you, 
for the very reason that I myself 
deserve every one's pity. 

Perhaps I may find an oppor- 
tunity to pay you a visit, as in 
your illness, and then may weep 
over the letter you mention, with 
you. But for the future, write 
nothing to me about the poor girl, 
that you think may not be com- 
municated to us all. 

And I charge you, as you value 
my friendship, as you wish my 
peace, not to say any thing of a 
letter you have from me , either to 
the naughty one, or to any body 
else. It was some little relief (the 
occasion given) to write to you, 
who must, in so particular a man- 
ner, share my affliction. A mother, 
Mrs. ^Norton, cannot forget her 
child, though that child could 
abandon her mother; and, in so 
doing, run away with all her mo- 
ther's comforts! — As I can truly 
say, is the case of

the man, whose gratitude I wished 
to engage, and whose protection 1 
was the more entitled to expect,

solute dependence upon himself. 
Indeed I once thought that it was 
all his view to briog me to this (as 
ho hated my family ;) and uncom- 
fortable enough forme, if it had 
been all. 

Can it be thought, my dear, that 
"'heart was aot more thauhalf

But with my relations it is otken-

pitied. They are, and no doubt 
will long be, unhappy. 

To judge of their resentmenti

You are very obliging to

I admire this kind assurance leas

so desirable to yotlrmotfier,upon

accept of a compliment, which 
must mean a slight to her. 

If any thing could give 
relish for life, after what I have 



iterly love, which has, for years, 
uninterruptedly bound us together 
as one mind. — And why, my dear, 
shonld yon defer giving (by a tie 
ttill stronger) another friend to 
Dne who has so few? 

I am glad you bare sent mr

Belford has not been able to deny 
it. So that (as we may'obierva

CLARISSA HARI.OWE. 



I have nothing to apprehend of 
tbiaeort.if 1 have the jtutice done 
ineinhialefters.whichMr.Belford 
asenres me I have: and therefore 
the particalarB of my story, 
thebaseartsof thiavileraan, .._, 
1 think, be best collected from 
those very letters of his (if Mr. 
Belfbrd can be prevailed upon to 
commuDicate them;) to trbich I 
dare appeal witli the same tnith 
and fervour as he did, who says — 
Oh thai one moiUil hear me ! and thai 
mine adi'eraart/ liad vrrilten a hook. 
— Surely , / Kould take ii upon mif 
lAoalders, and bind if to me 
crmeni For I covered not my tt 
greirieni, axAdmn, bg hiding 
inimrity fn my ftojom. 

There is one way which may be 
follea upon to induce Mr. Belford 
to communicate theaa lettera; 
sinoe he seems to have (and de- 
clares he always had] a sincere 
abhorrence of hiB friend's baaeneaa 
to me : hot that, you'll say , when 

S?n hear it, is a strange one. 
evertheless, I am very earnest 
upon it at present. 
It ia no other than this: 
1 think to make Mr. Belford the 
esecutor of my laat will [don't be 
surprised:] and with this view I 
permit his visits with the less 
Bcrupie: and every time I see him, 
from bisconcemfor me, am more 
and more inclined to do so. If 1 
hold in the same mind , and if he 
uecepttbe tmst, and will commu-, 
nicate the materials in his power, i 
those, joined with what you can 
famieh, will answer the whole 
ead. ' 

J know you will start at my 



notion of such an eiecutor: but 
pray, my dear, consider, in my 
present circumstances, what I can 
do better, aa I am empowered to 
makeawill, and have considerable 
matters in my own disposal. 

Your mother, lam sure, would 
not consent that you should take 
this office upon you. Itmightsub- 
Ject Mr. Hickman to the insulta of 
that -violent man. iUr*. Noyton 
cannot, for several reasons re- 
specting herself. My brother looka 
upon what I ought to have , as his 
right: my iinc/e//(iWnuJBi3already 
one of my trustees (as my cousin 
Morden is the other) for the estate 
my grandfather left me: butyou 
see I could not get from my own 
family the few guineas I left be- 
hind me at Harlowe Place; and 
my uncle AnlonJ/ once threatened 
tohavemy crandfathei-'awillcon- 
troverfed. My father! — To be 
sure, my dear, Icouhlnot eipect 
that my father would do all I wish 
ihould be done: and a teiil to 
je executed by a father for a 
daughter, (parts of it, perhaps, 
absolutely against his own judg- 
ment) carries somewhat daring 
and prescriptive in the very word. 

If indeed myousinJVfordenwere 

come in time, and would under- 
take this trust — but even Aim it 

ight subject to hazards ; and the 
more, as he ia a man of great 
spirit, and as the other man (of ns 
great) looks upon ma (unpro- 
tected aslhave long been) aahia 
property. 

Now Mr. Hclford, as I have al- 
ready mentioned, kuowa every- 
thing that baa paa»ft4. lie \* i 



56 

man of spirit, and, it Sbems, as 
fearless as the otiier, with more 
linmane qualities. You don't 
know, my dear, what inatancea of 
sincere humauity this Mr. Belford 
has shewn, not ouly 



the truel a 



, but 






ce.And Mrs. Li 
baB taken pains to inquire after 
Ilia general character-, and hears 
ayery goodoueof hiiLi, for justice 
and generosity in all bja concerns 
of iHmit and Tuum, &a they are 
called: be has a knowledge of taw 
taatters; and has two executor- 
shipa upon him at this time, in the 
discharge of which his lionour is 
anquestioned. 

All these reasons have already 
in a manner determined me to ask 



roake an intimate friend of Mr. 
Lovelace my eiecutor. 

This is certain: my brother will 
be more acquiescent a great deal 
in such a case with the articles of 
my will, as he will see, that it will 
be to no purpose to coutrovert 
some of them, which else, Idare 
say, he would controvert, orper- 
■uade my other friends to do so. 
And who would involve an exe- 
cutor in a laW'Suit, if they could 
help it? — Which would be the 
case, if any body were left whomjto take 
my brother could hopi 



OP 

you may believe, to have effects 
torn out of my father's hands: 
while Mr. Belford, who is a man of 
fortune (and a good economist in 
his own affairsV, would have no 
interest but to ao justice. 

Then he exceedingly pi 
some occasion to shew his readi- 
ness to serve me: andhewoaldbA 
able to manxge his violent friend, 
over whom he lias moreinflueuca 
than any othevpi 

But, after all, Iknownot, ifit' 
were not more eligible by far, that 
my story and ta^sdf luo, should ba: 
forgotten as soon as possible. Anl 
of this 1 shall have toe less doubtf , 
if the character of my parenti 
[you will forgive me, my dear 
cannot be guarded against the 
unqualified bitterness, which, troni 
your affectionate zeal for ir 

sometimes mingled with yi 

— a point that mii/lil, ana (I inmat 
upon it) must be well considered 
of, if any thing be done which your 
mother and you are desiroos to 
have done. The generality of ths 
world is too apt to oppose a, du- 



control; since my father has poa- 
aeesion of all , and ia absolutely 
governed by him. [Angry spirits, 
my dear, as 1 have often aeen, will 
be overcome by more angry ones, 
as well as sometimes be disarmed

heard for me. Yet, you bid me yourself enemies besides, if you 
hope, that the gruce 1 sued for, : were to come to me — don't you 
would, in tiiae, be granted. see that you would? 

The grace I then sued for was Mr. Brand may come, if hewilK 
indeed granted: but you are | He isaclergjm: 



afraid, you say, that they will 
wait for Mr. Brand's report, be- 
fore favour will be obtained in re- 
turn to the second letter which I 
wrote to my aiater; and you add, 
that I hare an indulgent mother, 
were she at liberty to act accord- 
ing to her own inclination; and 
that all will end well at last. 

But what, my dear Mrs.Norton, 
what is the grace I sue for in my 
second letter? — It ia not that 
they will receive me into favour 
— if they think it ia, they are 
mistaken. 1 do not, 1 cannot ex- 
pect that; nor, as I have often 
said, should I, if the^ icaulrl re- 
ceive me, bear to live in the eye of 
those dear frienda whom 1 have so 
grievously offended. 'Tia only, 
simply, a bleaaingi ask ; a bieaaing 
to die with, not to liae with. — Do 
they know that? And do ther 
know that their unkindneas will 
perha^ia shorten my date? So that 
their favour, if ever they intend *" 
grant it, may eomc too late. 

Once more, I desire jou not to 
think of coming to me. I have tio 
uneasiness now, but what pro- 
ceeds from the apprehenaion of 
seeing a man 1 woiild not see for 
the world, if I could help it; and 
from the severity of my nearest 
and dearest relations: aseverity 
enlirdij their own, I douht\ for you 
tell me that my braiker i$ at Edin- 
burgh! You would therefore 
iieighten their severity, and make 




think so, let him 
aay of me what he will. All my 
fear is, that, as he knows lamia 
disgrace with a family whose 
esteem lie is desirous to cultivate; 
and as he baa obligations to my 
uncle Harlo we, and to my father, 
he will be bat a languid acquitter 

— not that I am sB'aid of what , 
he, or any body in the world, c 
hear as to my conduct. You may, < 
my revered and dear friend, in-^ 
deed you may, rest satisfied, that 
that ia such as may warrant me to 
challenge the inquiries of the most 
officious. 

1 will send you copies of what 
passes, as you desire, when I . 
have an answer to my second

I most confoundedly cha- 
and disappointed: for 
on Saturday, arrived a 
meseengcr from Miaa Howe with 
a letter to my cousins*; which 1 
kueir nothiog of till yesterday: 
when Lady Sarah and Lady Betty 
were procured to be here, to ait 
in judgment upon it with the old 
peer, and my two cousins. And 



what? — Why, for the cruelty 
of Miss Harlowe: for have 1 com- 
mitted any new offence? And 
would I not have reinstated my- 
^'" "i her favour upon her own 
I I'l could? And is it fair 
E punish me for what is my mis- 
~ ttHsneTzli.ottblarol, \ 




fortune, andnotmy fault? Such 
eeail-jnilging fools as 1 have for 
my relations! I am aahamcd of 
them all. 

In that of Miss Howe was in- 
closed one to her from Miss Har- 
lowe*, to be tranamitted to mj 
cousins, containing a final rejec- 
tion of me; and that in very vehe- 
ment and positive terms; yet she 
pretenda, that in this rejection 
she is governed more hv principle 
than passion — [D—d lie as ever 
-wastoldil And, as aproof that 
she is, says, that she rnii forgive 
me, and does on this one con- 
dition, that I will never moleat 
her more — the whole letter so 
written, as to make hersulf moto 
admired, rnc more detested. 

What we have been told of the 
agitations and workings , and 
Bigbings and sobbinga, of the 
French prophets among us for- 
merly, was nothing at all to the 
scene exhibited by theae maudlin 
souls, at the reading of these 
letters; and of some affecting paa- 
sages extracted from another of 
my fair implacable's to MissHowo 
— such lamentations for the loss 
of BO charming a relation I Such 
applaudings of her virtue , of her 
esaltednesa of soul and sentiment! 
Such menaces of dis-inherisonal I, 
not needing their reproaches to be 
stung to the heart with my own 
reflections, and with the rage of 
disappointment; and as sincerely 
as any of them admiring ber — 
"What the devil," cried I. "is all

to letters or advices brought her 
from her implacable family, 

I have now completed my

to Epaom, to endeavour to put 
Belton's sister into possession of

which, I shall devote myself whol*

the lady. 

I was admitted to her presence 
last night; and found her visiblr

went home, I had your letter of

1 infinitely obliged to you 

for your kind and condeacendina 
letter. Aletter, however, whicE 
heightens my regrets, as itgivea 
me a new instance of what ahappy 
creature I might have been in an 
alliance bo much approved of by 
such worthy ladies, and which, 
on their accounts , and on thatoi 
Lord M, vpould hare been so re- 
putable to myself, and was once

But, indeed, indeed, madam, 
ray heart sincerely repulses the 
man, who, descended from such a 
ismily, could be guilty, /irgt, of 
such premeditated violence as be 
has been guilty of; and, as /it 
knows, further intended me, on the 
"ight previous to the day he set 
oulfor Berkshire; and. ner.l, pre-

Permit me, however, to make 
one request to my good Lord M. 
and to Lady Betti', and Lady 
Sarah, audtoj'ourkiiidsdf, and 
your sister — it ia, that you will 
all be pleased to join your autho- 
rity and interests to prevail upon 
Mr. Lovelace not to molest me 
further. 

Be pleaaed to tell him, that, if 1 
am designed tor life, it will be very 
cruel in him to attempt to hunt 
me out of it; for I am determined 
never to see him more, if I can 
help it. The more cruel, because 
he knows, thatl have nobody to 
defend me from him: nor do I 
wish to engage any body to to 
hurt, orto their own. 

If I am, on the other baud, des- 
tined for death, it will be no leas 
cruel, if he will uot permit mo to 
die in peace — since a ueaocahle 
and bappy end I wish him. In'

leturned, nitbout taking a cupy 
of it. The contente of it will booh 
be communicated to you, I pre- 
sume, by other handj. They are 
an abflolute rejection of thee — 
Poor Lovelace! — 



Tod have frequently offered to 
oblige me in any thing that ehall 
be within your power: andlhave 
such an opinion of you, as to be 
willing to hope , that at the times 
you made these offers, youmeaut 
more than mere compliment. 

I have, therefore, two requests 
to make you: the first I will now 
mention; tlieother,if this shall be 
complied with , otherwise not. 

It behoves me to leave beliind 
me such an account as may clear 
up my conduct to several of my 
friends who will not at present 
concern themselves about mc: 
and MisB Howe, and her mother, 
are very solicitous that 1 will 
dOBO. 

I am apprehensive that I shall 
not have time to do this; and you 
wiUnotwonderthatlhavelessand 
less inclination to set about such 
a paiufal task; especially as I 
find myself unable to look back 
with patience on what I have 
suffered: and sball be too much 
discomposed by the retrospection, 
werelobliged tomake it, to pro- 
ceed with we reiiuiajte temper in 
a task of slill greater importance 
which I have before me.

It is very evident to me, that 
your wicked friend has givea yon, 
from time to time, acircunu^n- 
tial account of all his behaviour 
lo me, and devices ai7ai>ijf me; and 
you have more than once assured 
me, that he has done mycliaracter 
all the justice I could wish for, 
both by writiog and speech. 

Now, sir, if 1 may have a fair, a 
faithful specimen from his letter* 
or accounts to you, written upon , 
some of the most interesting oc-- 
caeious , I shall be able to judge, 
whether there will or will not be a 
necessity forme, formy hononr'a 
sake, to enter upon the solicited 

You may be assured, frvm mT 
indused answer to the letter whim 
Miss Montague has honoured ma, 
with (and which you will bft' 
pleased to return me aa soon m 
read) that it is impossible for gift' 
everto think of your friendinttift' 
way I am importuned to thinic oC: 
him: he cannot therefore receivo' 
any detriment from the requested 
specimen; and I give ' 
honour, that no use -'--"^ 
of it to his prejudic' 
otherwise. And that it may not, 
after I am no more , I assure you 
that it is a main pari of my vita, 
that the passages you shall oblige 
me with shall be always in yoor 
own power, andnotin thatolany 
other person. 

If, sir, you think fit to complr

ISotr, Lovelace, since there are

never offered (tM jiiore lUminiiliiv

she may be made easier by it — 
since thou must fare better from

and, finally, since tbyactions have 
manifested, that thy letters are 
not the most guilty part of what 
she i'nom:' of tnee — I see not why 
I may not oblige her, upon her

aud for the reasons she has given ; 
and this without breach of the 
confidence due to friendly com- 
munications; especially asl might 
have added, Since Ihnu glorieit in \

it be any thing less than cutting 
% throat, or endangering my own 
neck, I will certainly comply, and 
be proud of having it in my power 
to oblige her. 

And now I am actually going to 
be busy in the extracts. 



You have engaged me to com- 
municate to you, upon honour, 
(making neither better nor worse 
of the matter) what Mr. Lovelace 
bas written to me in relation to 
youraelf, in the period preceding 
your going to Hampatead, and in 
that between the 11th and 19th of

have no view in this request, out 
to see if it be necessary for yon, 
from the account he gives, to 
touch the painful subjects your- 
self, for the sake of your own 
character. 

Your commands, madam, are of 
a very delicate nature, as IIict 
may seem to affect the r&reu of

"And now, madam," — See t}ie 
jinriigrapli marted loi'lA inferted

The lady is extremely imea^ 
lit the thoughts of your attempt- 
ing to visit her. For heaven's sake 
(yom* word being given) and for 
pity's sake {for she is really in a 
very weak and languiahiDg way) 
let me beg of you not to tliink 
ofit. 

Yesterday afternoon she re- 
ceived a cruel letter (as Mrs, Lo- 
vick supposes it to be, by the 
effect it had upon her) from her 
sister in answer to one written 
last Saturday, entreating a bless- 
ing and forgiveness from her pa- 
She acknowledges, that if the 
same decency andjnstice are ob- 
served in all your letters, as id the 
extracts I have obliged her with 
(as I have assured her tliey are), 
she shall think herself freed from 
the necessity of writing her own 
story: and this is an advantage 
to thee which thou oughtest to 
thank me for. 

But what thinkest thou is the 
second request she bad to make to 
me? No other than that 1 would 
be her ej-eculorl — Her motives 
will appear before thee in proper 
time; and then, I dare to answer, 
will be satisfactory. 

Yon cannot imagine how proud 
I am of this trust. I am afraid 
1 shall too soon come into the 
execution of it. As she is al- 
ways writiiiE, what a melancholy 
pleasure will the perusal and dis- 
position of her papers afeni ifiO.

I AH juat returned from viaiting 
the lady, and thanking her ' 
son for the honour she ha; 
me; and aasuring her, ifcalledto 
the sacred trust, of the utmost 
fidelity and exactneaa. 

I found her very ill. 1 took

ceived a second hard-hearted 
letter from her aister; and 



both together — otlierwiae, 
her aiater's aake, it were no matter 
how few saw the poor Bella', 
letter, 

I knew she would be displeased 
if I had censured the cruelty of 
her relations: I therefore only 
said, that surely alie must havs 
enemies, who hoped to find their 
account in keeping u 
aentments of her fricu^ against

But you only hope for /ar-

A blessing for what, sisterClary? 
Think for whati - However. I 
re'd your letter to my father and 
mother. 

I won't tell you what my father 
said ^ one who has the true sense 
you boast to have of your mis- 
deeds, may guess, without my 
teliiug you, what a justly incensed 
father would say on such an occa- 

My poor mother — O wretch! 
what has not your ungrateful folly 
cost my poor mother! — Had you 
been less a darling, you would 
not, perhaps, have oeen so grace- 
less: hut 1 never iu my life saw a 
cockered favourite come to good. 

My heart is full, and 1 can't 
help writing my mind; for your 
crimes have disgraced us all ; and 
I am aft'aid and ashamed to go to 
any public or private assembly or 
diversion: — Ineed not say why, 
when your actions are the subject 
either of the opeu talk , or of the 
afirpnting whispers, of both sexes 
at all such places. 

Upon the whole, I am sorry I 
have uo more comfort to send 
you: but I find nobody willing to 
forgive you. 

1 don't know what lime may do 
for you ; and when it is seen that 
your penitence is not owing more 
to disappointment than to true 
conviction; for it is toopropable, 
Miss Clary, that, had you gone on

No self- convicted criminal e?-er

by these lines. 

Indeed I must aay, that if the

not respected my future welfare, I 
had aot dared to taite this liberty. 
But my heart is set upon it, as 
upon a thing next to tiod Al-

Had my happy siater known my

wrung my heart, as she has done, 
by a severity which I must needs 
tliiuk unkind and unsisterly. 

But complaint of any uukind-

that it must be seen that my peni-

humble prayer is founded upon a 
true and unfeigned repentance: 
and this you will the readier b* 
lieve, if the creature whenever, 
thebeat of herfcmembrance, told 
her mamma a wilful falsehood, 
may be credited, when she de- 
clarer, as she does in the most so-

seducer with a determination not, 
to go off with him : that the rSall'

complete as to them. 



Hands;, Aug. I. 

Little as I have reason to ex- 
pect either your patient ear, or 
forgiving heart, yet cannot I for- 
bear to write to you once more (as 
a more pardonable intrusion, per- 
haps, than a visit would be), to 
beg of you to put it in my power 
to atone, as far as it is possible 
to atoue, for the injuries I have 
done you. 

Your angelic purity, and my 
awakened conscience, are stand- 
ing records of your eialted merit, 
and of my detestable baBeness: 
but your forgivcneaa will lay me 
under an eternal obligation te 
you. — Forgive me then, my dear-

visible anchor of my future hope!

THE HISTORy OF 



Tburida)- nlghl, Aug. 10. 

You have been infonned bj 
Tourville, how much iJelton'a ili- 
nesB aod affairs have engaged me, 
A3 well as Mowbray and h[m,BiiicE 
my former. I called at Smith'* 
on Monday in my way to Epaom. 

The lady wae gone to chapel: 
but I had the satisfaction to hear 
Bte was not worse; a,Dd left my 
compliments, and an intimation 
that 1 should be out of town for 
tbree or four days. 

I refer myself to Tourville, who 
will let you know the difficulty we 
had to arive out this meeJ' mistress, 
and frugal manager, with her 
cubs, and to give the poor fel- 
low's sister poaaession for him of 



□ bouse; heskulliing 
while at an inn at Croyd< 
dispirited to appear * ' 









But I must observe, that we 
were probably but just in time to 
save the nhaltered remains of his 
fortune from this rapacious wo- 
man, and her accomplices; for as 
he cannot live long, and she thinks 
HO, we found she had certainly 
taken measures to set up a mar- 
riage, and keep possession of a^U 
for nerself and her sons. 

Tourville will tell you how I 
was forced to chastise the quon- 
dam hostler in heraigbt, before I 
could drive him out of the house. 
He had the insolence to lay hands 
on me: and Imade him take but 
one step from the top to the bot- 
tomof apair ofstairs. Ithought 



his neck and alt his bones bad 
been broken. And then, he being 
carried out neck and heels, 
Thomaeine thought fit to walk 
out after him. 

Charming consequences of jtfeyi- 
iitg; the state we have been ao 
fond of estoUine! — Whatever 
it may be thought of ia strong 
healtb, .ikknessaad'lectimiigspiriU 
in the keeper, will bring him to 
see the di£l«rence. 

She should soon have him, she 
told a confidant I in the space of 
sii feet by five; meaning his bed; 
and then she would let nobody 
come near him but whom Bha 
pleased. The hostler fellow, I 
suppose, would then have been hia 
physician: his will ready madofor 
him; and widows' weeds probably 
ready provided; who knows, but 
she to appear in tbem in his own 
sight? _ As once I knew an in- 
stance in a wicked wife, insulting 
a husband she hated, when she 
thoughthimpastrecovery^thougb 
itgave the man such spirits, and 
Bucb a turn, that he got over it, 
and lived to see her in her coffin, 
dressed out in the very weeds she 
had insulted him in. 

Ho much, for the present, for 
Belt«n, and his Thomasine. 

I begin to pity thee heartily, 
now I see thee in earnest, in the 
fruitless iovo thou expressest tO 
this angel of a woman; and the 
rather, as, say what thou wilt, it is 
impossible she should get over her 
illness, and her Irieiida' imnla- 
cableness, of which she has nad 
fresh instances.

CaJjUSSA HAHLOWE. 



► Ifaope thou art not indeed dia- 
pleaaed with tiie esttacfB I have 
madefromthyletterBforher. The 
tettiag her know the justice thou 
hast done to her virtue in them, is 
so much in favour of thy inge- 
nDouaneBB (a quality, let me re- 
peat, that gives thee a superiority 
over common libertines) that I 
thiuk in my heart I was right; 
though to any other woman, and 
to one who had not known the 
worst of thee that she could know, 
it might have been wrong. 

If the enrf will justify the means, 
it is plain, that I have done well 
with regard to ye both; since I 
have made her easier, and Ihee ap- 
pear in a better light to her, than 
otherwise thou wouldst have done. 

But if, nevertheless, thou art dia- 
satiafied with my having obliged 
her in a point, which lacknow- 
ledge ru he Jdicate, let us canvass 
this matter at our first meeting; 
and then I will shew thee what the 
extracts <i)ere, and what counec- 
tions I gave them in thy favour. 

Butsurely thou dost notpretend 
\o say wbatl shall, or shallnot do, 
as to the esccutorship ! 

I am my ownman, I bope. I 
think thou sbouldst be glad to 
have the justificatjot] of her me- 
mory left to one, who, at the same 
time, tbonmay'stbe assured, will 
treat thee , and thy actions , with 
all the lenity the case will admit. 

1 cannot help espressing my 
surprise at one instance of thy 
selt- partiality ; and that is, where 
thou sayest, she had need, indeed, 
U CT)' out for meicy herself from 



/ler friends, whoknowsnot how to 
shew any. 

Surely thou canst not think the 
cases alike — for she , as 1 under- 
stand , desires but a last blessing, 
and a last forgiveness , for a fault 
in a manner inooltmlanj , if a fault 
at all; and does not so mnch as 
*ope to berecer'DBtZ,- thou, to be for- 
given premedil'iteil wrongs (which, 
nevertheless, she forgives, on con- 
dition to be no more molested by 
thee); and hopest to be received 
into faauur, and to make the finest 
jewel in the world thy absolute 

Sco[)erty in consequence of that 
irgiveneas. 

Iwill now briefly proceed to re- 
late what has passed since my 
last, as to the excellent lady. By 
) the account I aball give thee, thou 
wilt see, that she has troubles 
enough upon her, all springing 
originally from thyself, without 
needing to add more to them by 
new vexations. And aa long as 
thou canst exert thyself so very 
cavalierly at M. Hall, where every 
one is thy prisoner, I see not but 
the bravery of thy spirit may be 
aa well gratified m domineering 
there over half a dozen persons ot 
rank and distinction, as it could 
be over an helpless orphan, as I 
may call this lady, since she boa 
not a single iriend to stand by her, 
if I do not; and who will think 
herself happy, if she can refuge 
herself from thee, and Irom all tie 
world, in the arms of death.

Mr. Smitli and his wife, were with 
her. After beiDg at Highgate 
Chapel at divine service, she 
treated them with a little repast; 
and in the afternoon wasi at Is- 
lington Church , in her way home ; 
rehiroiag tolerably cheerful. 

She had received several letters 
in my absence, aa Mrs. Lovick ae- 
guaintedme, besides yours. Yours, 
itaeema, much diatreased her; but 
she ordered the meaneiiger, who 
pressed for an answer, to be told, 
that it did not require an imme- 

On Wednesday, she received a 
letter from lier uncle Harlowe*, 
in answer to one she had written 
to her mother on Saturday 
knees. It must be a very crnel 
one, Mrs. Lovick says, by the ef- 
feels it had upon her: for, when 
she received it, she was intending 
to take an afternoon aii-ing in a 
coach, hot was thrown into bo 
violent a fit of hysterica upon it, 
that she was forced to lie down; 
and (being not recovered by it) to 
go to bed about eight o'olouk. 

On Thursday morning she waa 
up very early; and haa recourse 
to the BCripturea to calm her mind, 
as she told Mrs. Lovick: and, 
weak aa she was, would so in a 
chair to Lincoln's-inn Chapel, 
about eleven. She was brought! 
home a little better; and then sat! 
down to write to her uncle. But| 
waa obliged to leave off several] 
timea — to struggle, as she told 
MrB,Lovick,foran humble temper. I 
"My heart," said she to the good 
woman, "is a proud heart, and 
•Seeiet»m& • ■ ( 



notyet, I£nd, enough mortified 
to my condition; but, do what { 
can, will ho for preseribing ro. 
sen ting thing;s to my pen." 

1 arrived in town ^om Belton'i. 
this Thursday evening, and went 
directly to Smith's. She waa too 
ill to receive my visit. But 04 
sending up my compliments, she 
sent me down word, that ' ' 
should be gtad to see me in 
morning. 

Mrs. Lovick obliged me wiUl 
the copy of a meditation*collectetf ' 
by the lady from the Scriptoreft. 
She haa intitled it, Poor moriat~ 
the cause ofOmr imn misery; w ia 
titled, I presume, with intentiul 
to take off the edge of her repia^ 
ings at hardships so dispropor^ 
tiooed to her fault, wereherfault 
even as great as she is inclined M'. 
think it. We may see by thifc; 
the method she tiikcs to forti^ 
her mind , and to which she owei 
in a great measure , the maf-""-'

deserved persecutions.

a rery different fashion; for that 
Nature was her guide in every 
thing, and Eaue her study ; which, 
joined with a. mingled dignity and 



ner, whether she received or paid 
a coiapliment, distinguiBhed her 
iibove all her sex. 

"He Bpoke not, he esid, his 
own sentiments only on this occa- 
eioii, hut those of every body : for 
that the praises of Miss Clarissa 
Harlowe were such a favourite 
topic, that a person who could 
not speak well upon any other 
sabject, was sure to speak well 
upon that; because he could say 
nothing but what he had heard re- 
peated and applauded twenty 
times over." 

Hence it was, perhaps, that 
t^iis novice accounted for the best 
things he said himself; though I 
must own that the personal know- 
ledge of the lady which I am fa- 
voured with, made it easy to me 
to lick into ahape what the good 
woman reported to me, as the 
character given ker by the young 
levite: forwho, evonno " "" " 
decline of health, sees 
all these attributes belong to her ? 

I suppose he has not been long 
come from college, and now thinks 
' he has nothing to do , but to blaze 
away for a scholar among the 
v/nnrant; as such young fellows 
ace apt to think thoee who cannot 
cap verses with them, and tell us 
how an ancient author expressed 
huDself in Latin on a subject, 
upon which, however, they may 
know how, as well as that author, 
to eipresB thenuelvea in Kngliah. 



Mrs. Smith was so taken with 
him, that she would fain havoin- 
troduced him to the lady, not 
questioning but it would be very 
acceptable to her to see one naa 
knew her and her friends so nelli 
but this he declined for aeva'al 
reasons^ as he called them; which 
he gave. One was, that peraonl 
of his cloth should be very caiii- 
tiouB of the compuny they kwm m, 



,andwhereawomashadiiuri^ 
her repulalion — [I wish I had been 
there when he gave himself these 
airsj. Another, that he was de- 
sired to inform himself of her pre- 
sent way of life, and vrfao bet 
visitors were; for, as to the prw*ei 
Mrs. Smith gave the lady, be 
hinted, that ska seemed to be > 
good-natured woman, and might 
(though for the lady's sake h> 
hoped not) be too partial and 
short-sighted to be tmsted to ab- 
solutely, in a concern of so high A 
nature, as he intimated the task 
was which he had undertaken; 
nodding out words of doubtful im- 
port; and assuming aira of great 
significance (as I could gather] 
throughout the whole conversa- 
tion. And when Mrs, Smith told 
him, that the lady was in a vei; 
bad state of health, he gava > 
careless shrug — She may be very 



f dare say, yet, to atone for 
very great lapse, and to expeet to

I could not look forward to my

with a contrition so lieep, that I 
deserved not, weie it known, to 
be turned over from the tender 
nature of a mother, to the np- 
braidiug peu of an uncle ! and to 
be wounded by a cruel question, 
pat by bim in a shocking man- 
ner; and which a little, a 
very tittle time, will better an- 
swer than I can: for I am not 
either a hardened or shameless 
creature: if 1 were, I should not 
have been so solicitous to obtain 
the favour 1 sued for.

asked it as well for my father and

Ism sure, theijal least will be un-

refused it to me.

I CAN write Just now but a few

reasons for that measure are: and 
yet 1 am firmly of opinion, that 
none of your reiationa should be 
named for the trust But I dwell 
the less upon this subject, as I 
hope (and cannot bear to appre- 
hend the contrary) that you will 
still live many, many years.

I have a particular opportunity 
of sending this by a friend of my 
aunt flarman's; who is ready to 
set out for London (and this occa- 
sions my hurry) and is to return 
immediately. I expect therefore 
by him a large packet from you ; 
and hope and long for news of 
your amended health : which 
Leave n grant to the prayers of 
Your ever affectionate 

Anna Howe. 



I wn.1, send you a large packet,

but not all that is come to my

friends are very severe; too severe 
for any body who loves them not, 
tc see their tetters. You, my 
dear, would not call them my' 
frrends, you said, long ago; but 
my relatiatis: indeed I cannot caU 



them my relations, I think ! — But 
I am ill; and therefore perhapa

is dimcult to go out of oumelvfl

As Mr. Belford has transcribed

friend's letters, the passages which 
accompany this, I must insist, that 
you suffer no soul but yourself to 
peruse them; and that you return 
them by the very first oppor-

made of them that may do hurt

Ab your uncle Harlowe ohooBea 
It to answer your pert letter to 
him; and as mmo written to you 
before,* was written as if it were 
in the spirit of prophecy, as you 
have found to your sorrow; and 
as you are now making yourself 
worse than you are in your health, 
and better than you are in your 
penitence, an me are very well iw-

as board, no doubt (for is not bia

don't be ashamed to be asked 
after what may naturally come of

indeed, would have become you 
for eighteen years of your life — 
you'll be pleased to mark that — 
but makes no good figure com- 
pared with your behaviour since 
the beginning of April last. So 
pray don't take it up, and wipe

Your folly has ruined all our 
peace. And who knows where it 
may yet end? — Your poor father

it me, poor man ; and do you lay it 
to your heart : 

"A fatherwaketh for his daugh-

All your friends here, my dear 
young lady, now seem set upon 
proposing to you to go to one of 
the plantations. This, 1 believe, 
to some misrepresenta- 
Mr. Brand; from whom 
they have received a letter. 

Iwish, with all my heart, that 
you could, consistently withyour 
WD notions of honour, yield to 
he pressing request of all Mr,

that he is. 

1 should be very glad to have in 
readiness, upon occasion, soma 
brief particulars of your sad story 
under your own band. But let mt 
tell you, at the same time, that nA 
misrepresentations, nor even yaax 
own confession, shall lessen my 
opinion either of your piety, or M 
your prudence in essential point«t : 
becaiisel know itwas always your 
humble way to make light faulta 
heavy against yourself: and well

who ever had so few, and those

THE inSTORY OF 

LETTEH XLVm. and also partieulawjOrbriefheadfl 

of my sadatory, in order toaerva 
me SB occasions shall offer. 1 
dear good Mrs. Norton, you Eh 
have a whole packet of papers, 
which I have sent to my JUisB 
Howe, when she returns them; 
and you Bhail have likewise an- 
other packet (and that with this ' 
letter) which I cannot at present < 
think of Bending to that deaf ' 
friend, for the Bake of my c 
retttliims; whom, without aeo; 
that packet, she is but too ready 
to cenaure heavily. From theae 
you will be able to collect a great 
dealof my story. But for what i*. 
previous to these papers, and' 
which mare particularly relatea td-' 
what I have suffered from vLr. 
Lovelace, you must have patience! 
for at present 1 have neither heM' 
norheartfor such subjects. Thti 
papers 1 send you with th^, will. 
be those mentioned in thejinaiv 
gin,* Tou must restore them ta 
me as soon as perused; and npou 
your honour make no use of them^ 
or of any intelligence you hav* 



What Mr. Brand, or any body, 
can have written or said to my 
prejudice, I cannot imagine; and 
yet some evil reports have gone 
out against me ; as I find by some 
hints, in a very severe letter writ- 
ten to me by my uncle Antony. 
Such a letter as I believe never 
was written to any poor creature, 
whoby ill health of body, as well 
as mind , was before tottering on 
the brink of the grave. But my 
iriends may possibly be better 
justified than the reporters^ for 
who knows what they may have 
heard? 

You give me a kind caution, 
which seems to imply more than 
you express, when you advise me 
against countenancing visitors 
that may discredit me. You 
should, in so tender B point, my 
dear Mrs. Norton, have apoken 
quite out. Surely, I have had 
afflictions enough to strengthen 
my miud , and to enable it to bear 
the worst that can now happen. 
But I will not puzzle myself by 
conjeclural euiVs; as I miijhl per- 
haps do, if I had not enough that 
were certain. 1 shall hear all, 
when it is thought proper that 
should. Meantime, let me say, 
forjour satisfaction, thatlknow 
not that I have any thing criminal 
or disreputable to ant — '—

from me, but by my previoos con- 
sent. 

These communicatious you 
must not, my good Mrs. Norton, 
look upon as appeals against my 
relations. On tbe contrary, I am 
heartily sorry, that thev have in- 
curred the (lispleaBiire of so excel- 
lent a divine as Dr. Lewen. Hut 
TOO desire to have every thiug 
Wore you: and, I think you 
ought: for who knows, as you Bay, 
bat you may be apphed to at last 
to administer comfort from their 
conceding heartn, to one that 
wants it: and wbo, sometimes, 
judging by what she knows of 
hei own heart, thinka herself en- 
titled to it, 

I know that I have a most in- 
dulgent and sweet-tempered mo- 
ther; but having to deal with vio- 
lent spirits, she has too often for- 
feited that peace of mind which 
she so much prefers , hy her over 
concern to preserve it. 

I am sure ehe would not have 
turned me over for an answer to a 
letter written with so contrite and 
fervent a spirit, as was mine to 
her, to amiwcu/iiiespirit, had she 
been left to herself. 

Bat, my dear Mrs. Norton, 
might not, think you, the revered 
!»oy have favoured me with one 
pnwtfffline? Ifnot,miehtnot3/OM

THE mSTORY OP 



give you my reasons for taking 
it* 

It must be expected , that situa- 
tions uncommonly difficult, will 
make necessary some extraordi- 
nary steps , which , but for those 
situations, would be hardly ex- 
cusable. It will be very happy 
indeed, and somewhat wonderful, 
if all the measures I have been 
driven to take should be right. A 
pure intention , void of all unduti- 
ful resentment, is what must be 
my consolation, whatever others 
may think of those measures, when 
they come to know them: which 
however, will hardly be, till it is 
out of my power to justify them, 
or to answer for myself. 

I am fflad to hear of my cousin 
Mordens safe arrival. I should 
wish to see him methinks ; but I 
am afraid, that he will sail with the 
stream, as it must be expected 
that he will hear what they have 
to say first. — But what 1 most 
fear, is, that he will take upon 
himself to avenge me — rather 
than he should do so, I would 
have him look upon me as a 
creature utterly unworthy his 
concern; at least of his vindictive 
concern. 

How soothing to the wounded 
heart of your Clarissa, how balmy, 
are the assurances of your con- 
tinued love and favour; — love 
me, my dear mamma Norton, con- 
tinue to love me , to the end ! — I 
now think that I may, without 
presumption, promise to deserve 
your love to the end. And when 

* She means that of making Mr. Bel- 
ford her executor. 



I am gone , cherish my memory in 
your worthy heart ; for in so doing 
you will cherish the memory of 
one who loves and honours you 
more than she can express. 

But when I am no more, get 
over, I charge you, as soon as you 
can, the smarting pangs of grief 
that will attend a recent loss; and 
let all be early turned into that 
sweetly melancholy regard to 
MEMORY, which, engagmg us to 
forget all faults, and to remember 
nothing but what was thought 
amiable, gives more pleasure than 
pain to survivors — especially if 
they can comfort themselves with 
the humble hope , that the divine 
mercy has taken the dear departed 
to itself. 

And what is the space of time to 
look backward upon , between an 
early departure, and the longest 
survivance ! — And what the con- 
solation attending the sweet hope 
of meeting again, never more to 
be separated, never more to be 
pained, grieved, or aspersed; but 
mutually blessing, and being 
blessed, to all eternity? 

In the contemplation of this 
happy state, in which I hope, in 
God's good time, to rejoice with 
you, my beloved Mrs. Norton, and 
also with my dear relations, all 
reconciled to, and blessing the 
child against whom they are now 
so much incensed , I conclude my- 
self 

Your ever dutiful and 

affectionate

She has no virtue; is all pride; 
and her devil is as much MijWiiher, 
as villhout her. 

How then can the fall of such a 
one create a proper distress, when 
all the circumstances of it are con- 
sidered? Fordoes she not brazen 
out her crime, even after detec- 
tion? Knowing her owu guilt, she 
calls for Altamont's vengeance on

excellent woman is from her re-

trary, to find reason to justify 
them at her own expense; and 
seetns more conceniw for their 
cruelty to her for their sakea here- 
after, when sbe shall be uo more, 
than for her own : for, as to her- 
self, she is sure, she says, God will 
forgive her, though no one on 
earth will. 

On every estraordinary provo- 
cation she baa recourse to the 
scriptures, and endeavours to re- 
gulate her vehemence by sacred 
precedents. "Betterpeople, she 
says, have been more afllicted 
tlinn she, grievous as she some- 
times thinks her afflictions: and

occasion I have mentioned (some 
new instances of impUcablenesa 
from her friends) the inclosed me- 
ditation will shew, how mildly, 
and yet how forcibly abe com- 
plains. Seeif thou, in the wicked 
levity of thy heart, canst apply it 
to thy ease as thou didst the other.

THE mSTOEY OP 



Be it indeed that I have erred, my 
error remaineth with myself. 

To her that is affUcted^pity should 
he shewn from her friends. 

But she that is ready to slip with 
her feet, is as a lamp despised in the 
thought of them that are at ease. 

There is a shame which hringeth 
sin, and there is a shame which 
hringeth glory and grace. 

Have pity upon me, have pity upon 
me, O ye my friends! for the hand 
of God hath touched me. 

If your soul were in my sours 
stead, I also could speak as ye do : 
I could heap up words against 
you 

But I would strengthen you with 
my mouth, and the moving of my lips 
should assuage your grief. 

Why will ye hreak a leaf driven 
to and frof Why will ye pursue 
the dry stuhhle f Why will ye write 
hitter words against me, and make 
me possess the iniquities of my youth ? 

Mercy is seasonable in the time of 
affliction, as clouds of rain in the 
time of drought. 

Are not my days few ? Cease then, 
and let me alone, that I may take 
comfort a little — before I go whence 
1 shall not return; even to the land 
of darkness, and shadow of death I 

Let me add , that the excellent 
lady is informed , by a letter from 
Mrs. Norton, that Colonel Morden 
is just arrived in England. He is 
now the only person she wishes to 
see. 

I expressed some jealousy upon 

it, lest he should have place given 

/jver mom the executorship. She 

jTifltZr/. that she iiad no thouglits to 



do so now; because such a trust, 
were he to accept of it (which she 
doubted) might, from the nature 
of some of the papers , which in 
that case would necessarily pass 
through his hands, occasion mis- 
chief between my friend and him, 
that would be worse than death 
for her to think of. 

Poor Belton I hear is at death's 
door. A messeneer is just come 
from him , who tens me , he cannot 
die till he sees me. I hope the 
poor fellow will not go off yet: 
since neither his affairs in this 
world, nor for the other are in 
tolerable order. I cannot avoid 
going to the poor man. Yet am 
unwilling to stir, till I have an as- 
surance from you, that you will 
not disturb the lady : for I know 
he will be very loth to part with 
me, when he gets me to him. 

Tourville tells me how fast thou 
mendest: let me conjure thee not 
to think of molesting this incom- 
parable woman. For thy own 
sake I request this as well as for 
hers, and for the sake of thy given 
promise : for should she die within 
a few weeks , as I fear she will , it 
will be said, and perhaps too 
justly , that thy visit has hastened 
her end. 

In hopes thou wilt not, I wish 
thy perfect recovery: else that 
thou mayst relapse, and be con- 
fined to thy bed.

tbrbear the thoughts of any further ,

What an unmerciful fuUow art 
thou! A man has no need of a 
conscience, who has such an im- 
pertinent monitor. But if Kic. 
liowe wrote a play that answers 
not his title, am 1 to be reflected 
upon for that? — 1 have sinned; 
1 repent; I would repair — she 
forgives my sins; she accepts my 
repentance; but she wou't let me 
repair — what wouldst thou have 
me to do? 

But get thee gone to Beiton, rb 
soon as thou canst. Yet whether 
thou goest or not, up I munf go, 
and see what I can do with t<ie 
sweet oddity myself The moment 
these pretcribiitff varlets will let

Colonel Morden, thou Iiast

or secretly, who has not? The

wench, when he angles for a man,

it will. 

I have often heard my beloved

iBtinction and esteem. I wish 
he conld make matters a little 
easier, for her mind's sake, be-

Methinka I am sorry for honest 
Belton. But a man cannot be ill, 
or vapourish, but thou lifteat up 
thy shriefc-owl note, and killest

fellow, who ia fit for a dnimmei' 
in death's forlorn-hope, could 
take so much delight, aa thou dost, 
in beating a dead march with thy 
goose -quills. 

Whereas, didst thou but know 
thine own talents, thou art formed 
to give mirth by thy Tery appear-

on thy friendship wiiare Miss Mar- 
lowe's humoar was concerned. 

I had no other pltLce so ready, 
and so was forced to go to my old 
lodginga, where hIbo my ward- 
robe is; and there I poured out 
nuUionB of ciiraes upon the whole 
crew, and refused to see cither 
Sally or Folly; and this not only 
for suffering the ladj to eseape, 
bat for the vitlainous arrest, and 
for then? detestable insolence to 
her at the officer's house. 

I dressed myself in a aever-wom 
anit, which I had intended for one 
of my wedding suita; and liked 
m^eelf bo well, that 1 began to 
think with thee that my outside 
was the best of me.

rushed my honour; the woman be- 
hind the compter all io flutters; 
respect and fear giving due so- 
lemnity to her featorea; and her 
knees, 1 doubt not, knocking 
against the inside of her wainscot 

Your servant, madam — Will, 
let the fellows move to some dis- 
tance, and wait. 

You have a young lady lodges 
here; Miss Harlowe, madam: is 
she above? 

Sir, sir, an' please your hononr

was making towards the stairs. 

Sir, sir, the lady, the lady is 
not at home— she is abroad — she 

In the country! not at home! — 
Impossible. You will not pass

' I iiivsl see her. 1 have business of

Indeed, sir, the lady is not at

She then rung a bell; John, 
cried ahe, pray step down! — In-

of hia journeymen, by her saney

THE HISTORY OP 



My dear, said she, the gen- 
tleman will not believe Miss Har- 
lowe is abroad. 

John bowed to my fine clothes: 
Your servant, sir — indeed the 
lady is abroad. She went out of 
town this morning by six o'clock 
— into the country — By the doc- 
tor's advice. 

Still I would not believe either 
John or his wife. I am sure , said 
I , she cannot be abroad , I heard 
she was very ill — she is not able 
to go out in a coach. Do you know 
Mr.Belford, friend? 

Yes, sir; I have the honour to 
know 'Squire Belford. He is gone 
into the country to visit a sick 
friend; he went on Saturday, 
sir. 

This had also been told from 
thy lodgings to Will , whom I sent 
to desire to see thee on my first 
coming to town. 

WeU, and Mr. Belford wrote 
me word that she was exceeding 
ill. How then can she be gone 
out? 

O, sir, she is very ill; very ill, 
indeed — she could hardly walk 
to the coach. 

Belford, thought I, himself 
knew nothing of the time of my 
coming: neither can he have re- 
ceived my letter of yesterday: and 
so ill, 'tis impossible she should 
go out. 

Where is her servant? Caliber 
servant to me. 

Her servant, sir, is her nurse: 
she has no other. And sJie is gone 
with her. 

Well, friend, I must not be- 
lieve you. You'll excuse me ; but 



I must go up stairs myself. And 
was stepping up. 

John hereupon put on a serious, 
and a less respectful face — Sir, 
this house is mine ; and — 

And what, friend? not doubt- 
ing then but she was above. I 
must and will see her. I have 
authority for it. I am a justice of 
peace. I have a search-warrant. 

And up I went ; they following 
me, muttering, and in a plaguy 
flutter. 

The first door I came too was 
locked. I tapped at it 

The lady, sir, has the key of 
her own apartment. 

On the inside I question not, 
my honest friend ; tapping again. 
And being assured, if she heard 
my voice , that her timorous and 
soft temper would make her betray 
herself by some flutters, to my 
listening ear, I said aloud, I am 
confident Miss Harlowe is here: 
dearest madam, open the door: 
admit me, but for one moment to 
your presence. 

But neither answer nor flutter- 
ing saluted my ear; and the people 
bemg very quiet, I led on to the 
nextapartment; and thekeybeinff 
on the outside, I opened it, and 
looked all round it, and into the 
closet. 

The man said he never saw so 
uncivil a gentleman in his life. 

Hark thee, friend, said I; let 
me advise thee to be a little de- 
cent ; or I shall teach thee a les- 
son thou never leamedst in all thy 
life. 

Sir, said he , 'tis not like a gen- 



EmHn, to aScpnt b. man in his 
■a honse. 
Then pr'ythee man, replied I, 
n't CTOw upon thine ana dung- 



Ill 



HAllLOWB, 

I can guess, sir. 

Whomdoyoueuesame tobe? 

Your name ia Mr. Lovelace , sir, 
I make no doubt. 

The very aamfl. But how came 
you to guess bo well, dame Smith! 
You never saw me before — did 



PIT break it open ; — pushing hard 
Bgainstit, that it cracked aguin. 

The man looked pale; and 
trembling with bis fright, madea 
l>lagtiy long face; and called to 
one of hia Eoddice-makerB above, 
Joseph, come di>u>n quickly. 

Joseph came down, a lion's- 
fftce grinning fellow; thick and 
short, and bushy-headed like an 
old oak-pollard. Then did master 
John put on a sturdier look. But 
J only hummed a tane , traversed 
allthe other apartments, sounded 
the paaaages with myknucklea, to 
find whether there were private 
doors, and walked up the next 

Stur of stairs singing all the nay ; 
ohn and Joseph, and Mrs. Smitn, 
following me trembling. 

I looked round me there, and 
went into two open-door bed- 
ebambers; searched the closets, 
Uiepatsages, and peeped through 
the c^~hole of another; No Miss 
H&rlowe, by Jupiter! WhatshuU 
I do 1 ~ What shall I do ! as the 
nrls say.— No w will she be grieved 
Utat she is out of the way. 

1 said this on purpose to find 
oat whether these people knew the 
lady's story; and had the anewer 
I Mpeeted from Mrs. Smith — I 
believe n6t, sir. 

Why BO, Mrs. Smith? Do you 
JmcivirliQlam? 



compliment, andmissedit. 

"lis easy to guess, sir; for 
there cannot be two such gen- 
tlemen as you. 

Well said, dame Smith— but 
mean you ijtmd or bad? — Hand- 
some was the least 1 thought she 
would have said. 

Heave you to guess, sir- 
Condemned, thought 1, by my- 
self, ott this appeal. 
Why, father Smith, thy wife is 

awit, man? Did'st thou ever 

find that out before? — But where 
is widow Lovick, dame Smith? 
!Vly cousin John Belford says she 
is a very good woman. Is she 
within? Or is she gone with Miea 
Harlowe too? 

She will be within by-and-by, 
sir. She is not with the lady. 

Well, but ray good, dear Mrs. 
Smith , whither is the lady gone? 
And when will she retnm? 



I CI 



'ttell. 



Don't tell fibs, dame Smith; 
don't tell fibs , chucking her under 
the chin : which made John's upper 
lip, with chin shortened, rise to 
his nose. — I am sure j'ouknowl 
— Buthere'aanotherpau: of stairs: 
let us see ; who lives up there? But 
hold, here's another room locked 
up , tapping at the door — Who's 
at home? cried I. 



112 



THJB HISTORY OF 



That's Mrs.LoTick's apartment, 
she is gone out, and has the key 
with her. 

Widow Lovick ! tapping again, 
I believe you are at home: pray 
open the door. 

John and Joseph muttered and 
whispered together. 

No whispering, honest friends: 
'tis not manners to whisper. Jo- 
seph, what said John to thee? 

John, sir ! disdainfully repeated 
the good woman. 

I beg pardon, Mrs. Smith: but 
you see the force of example. Had 
you shewed your honest man more 
respect, / should. Let me give 
you a piece of advice — Women 
who treat their husbands irreve- 
rently, teach strangers to use 
them with contempt. There, 
honest master John ; why dost not 
pull off thy hat to me? — 0, so 
thou wouldst, if thou hadst it on: 
but thou never wearest thy hat in 
thy wife's presence, I oelieve; 
dost thou? 

None of your fleers and your 
jeersj sir, cried John, I wish every 
married pair lived as happily as 
we do. • 

I wish so too, honest friend. 
But I'll be hanged if thou hast any 
children. 

Why so, sir? 

Hast thou? — Answer me, man? 
Hast thou, or not? 

Perhaps not, sir. But what of 
that? 

What of that? — Why I'll tell 
thee: the man who has no children 
by his wife, must put up with plain 
John. Hadst thou a child or two, 
thou'dst be called Mr. Smith, with 



a curtsey, or a smile at leaat, at 
every word. 

You are very pleasant, sir, re- 
plied my dame. I fancy, if either 
my husband or I had as much to 
answer for as I know whom, we 
should not be so merry. 

Why then, dame Smith, so 
much the worse for those who 
were obliged to keep you com- 
pany. But I am not memr — I 
am sad! — Hey ho! — Where 
shall I find my dear Miss Har- 
lowe? 

My beloved Miss Harlowe I [call- 
ing at the foot of the third pair of 
stairs] if you are above, for 
Heaven's sake answer me. I am 
coming up. 

Sir, said the good man, I wish 
you'd walk down. The servants' 
rooms, and the working rooms, 
are up those stairs, and another 
pair ; and nobody's there that you 
want. 

Shall I go up and see if Miss 
Harlowe be there, Mrs. Smith? 

You may, sir, if you please. 

Then I won't go ; for, if she was, 
you would not be so obliging. 

I am ashamed to give you all 
this attendance: you are the poli- 
test traders I ever knew. Honest 
Joseph, slapping him upon the 
shoulder on a sudden, which made 
him jump, didst ever ^rin for a 
wager, man? For me rascal 
seemed not displeased with me; 
and, cracking his flat face from 
ear to ear, with a distended mouth, 
shewed his teeth, as broad and as 
black as his thumb nails. — But 
don't I hinder thee ? What canst 
earn a day, man? 



^L- Haifa crOTTii, I can earn a day! 
^Miith an &ir of pride and petulance, 
^Bt being startled. 
^K There, then, is a day's wages 
Hvir tliee. But thou needeat not 
^^«ttend me farther. 

Come, Mrs. Smith, come John, 
(Master Smitb, 1 should say) let's 
walk dotra, and give me an ac- 
eoout where the Indy ia gone, and 
when she will return. 

So down stairs led I John and 
Joseph (tbough I had discharged 
the latter) and my dame following 
me, to shew their complaianuce to 
ft stranger. 

1 re-entered one of the first 
floor rooma, I have a great mind 
to be your lodger : for Inever saw 
Btich obliging folks in my life. 
What rooms EaTe you to let? 

None at all, sir. 

I am sorry for that. But whose 
isthia? 

Mine, sir, chuflilv said John. 

T^ine, man? Whythenlwill 
take it of thee. This, and a bed- 
chamber, and a garret for one ser- 
Tftnt, will content me. 1 will give 
thee thine own price, and half-a 
guinea a day over, for those" " 



CIiAElSSA HAra.OWE. 



For ten guineas a day, 

Hold, John', (master Smith I|back3 
should say) — Before thou speak- with each 
ert, consider — I won't be af- 
fronted, 



113 

Well, then, I am glad I pre. 
vented you; for such words better 
become my mouth than yours. 
But I must lodge with you till the 
lady returns. I believe 1 must. 
However, you may be wanted in 
the shop; BO we'U talk that over 

Down I went, they paying dili ■ 
gent attendance on my steps. 

When I came into the shop, 

eiug no chair or stool, I went 
behind the compterj and sat down 
under an arched kmd of canopy 
of carved work, which these proud 
traders, emnlatine the royal niehe- 
fiUerSjOfteo give ULCmselvea, while 
a joint-stool, perhaps, serves thoEe 
by whom they get their bread: 
such is the dignily of trade in this 
mercantile naljon! 

1 looked about me, and above 
me, and told them, I was very 
proud of my seat; askinc, if John 
were ever permitted to fill this su- 
perb niche? 

Perhaps he was, he said, very 
surlily. 

That is it, that makes thee look

a purse-mo utb, as it'ehe would not

glass, and gave Will sii. There

He did, gcinning with bia teeth 
oat before; which touching my 
coa9ctence,!iB the loss of them was 
owing to me; Joseph, said l,come 
hither. Come hither, man, when 
I bid thee. 

He stalked towards me, his 
hands behiud hitn, half willing, 
and half unwilling. 

I suddenly wrapped my arm 
round his neck. Will, thy pen- 
knife, this moment. D — n the fel- 
low, Where's thy penknife?

while my other hand was mu;i/ling 
about bis cursed chaps, as if 1 
would take his teeth out, 

I will pay thee a good price, 
man: don't struggle thus! the 
penknife. Will! 

OLord, cried Joseph, struggling 
still more and more. And out 
comes Will's prmiing knife; for 
the rascal is a gardener in the 
conntry. I have only this, sir. 

The best in the world to lance a 
gum, D — n the fellow, why dost

tragi- comical, I let him go. 

I only wanted, said 1, to take 
out two or three of this raaeal^: 
broad teeth, to put them into my 
servant's jaws — and I would have 
paid him his price for them. '' 
would, by my aoul, Joseph. 

Joseph shook his ears ; and wilk' 
both hands streaked down, amootfa, 
as it would lie, his busby baiij 
and looked at me, as if he knew 
not whether be should lau^h or hi 
angry: but, after a stupid staro^ 
or two, stalked off to the otiiei

THE HISTORY OF 



now I hope you will buy some- 
thing for yourself. Nobody shall 
use you better, nor sell you 
cheaper. 

Come, said she, give me six- 
penny worth of Portugal snuff . 

They shewed me where it was, 
and I served her : and said, when 
she would have paid me, I took 
nothing at my opening. | 

If I treated her footman, she 
told me, I should not treat her. 

Well, with all my heart, said I : 
'tis not for us tradesmen to be 
saucy — is it, Mrs. Smith? 

I put her six -pence in my 
pocket; and seizing her hand, 
took notice to her of the crowd 
that had gathered about the door, 
and besought her to walk into the 
back-shop with me. 

She struggled her hand out of 
mine, and would stay no longer. 

I bowed, and bid her kindly 
welcome, and thanked her, and 
hoped I should have her custom 
another time. 

She went away smiling; and 
Andrew after her; who made me 
a fine bow. 

I began to be out of coun- 
tenance at the crowd, which 
thickened apace; and bid Will 
order the chair to the door. 

Well, Mrs. Smith, with a grave 
air, I am heartily sorry Miss Har- 
lowe is abroad. You don't tell me 
where she is? 

Indeed, sir, I cannot. 

You will not , you mean. — She 
could have no notion of my 
coming. I came to town but last 
night. I have been very ill. She 
has almost broken my heart by 



her cruelty. You know my story, 
I doubt not. Tell her, I must go 
out of town to-morrow morning. 
But I will send my servant, to 
know if she will favour me with 
one half -hour's conversation; for 
as soon as I get down, I shall set 
out for Dover, in my way to 
France, if I have not a counter- 
mand ^om her who has the sole 
disposal of my fate. 

And so, flinging down a Portu- 
gal Six-and- thirty, I took Mr. 
Smith by the hand, telling him, I 
was sorry we had not more time to 
be better acquainted: and bidding 
farewell to honest Joseph (who 
pursed up his mouth as I passed 
b^ him, as if he thought his teeth 
still in jeopardy) and Mrs. Smith 
adieu, and to recommend me to 
her fair lodger, hummed an ur, 
and the chair being come , whipt 
into it; the people about the door 
seeming to be in good humour 
with me; one crying, A pleasant 
gentleman, I warrant him I And 
away I was carried to White's ac- 
cording to direction. 

As soon as I came thither, I 
ordered Will to go and chazige 
his clothes , and to disguise him- 
self by putting on his black wig, 
and keeping his mouth shut; and 
then to dodge about Smith's, to 
inform himself of the lady's mo- 
tions. 

« « « 

I QivE thee this impudent Re- 
count of myself, that tnou mayeat 
rave at me, and call me hardened, 
and what thou wilt. For, in the 
first place, I, who had been so 
lately ill, was glad I was alive; 



and then I iras so balbcil by my 
eharmer'a nneipected absence, 
aad so ruffled by th&t., And br the 
bhiff trefttmeut of father John, 
that I bad no other way to avoid 
being out of humour with all I met 
with. Moreover, I waa rejoiced to ' 
find, by the lady's absence, and 
by ner going oat at six in the 
morning, tbAt it was impossible 
she shonld be so ill as thou repre- 
sentest her to be; and this gave 
me Btill higher spirits. Then I 
know the sex always love cheerful 
and bumourouB fellows. The dear 
isreatiu'e herself used to bepleased 
with my gay temper and lively 
manner; and had she been told, 
that I was blubbering for her in 
the back'shop, she would have 
' ' still more than she 



Furthermore, I was sensible, 
that the people of the houee mast 
needs have a terrible notion of me, 
as a savage , bloody-minded , ob- 
durate fellow; a perfect woman- 
eater; and, no doubt, expected to 
see me with the claws of a lion, 
and the fangs of a tiger; and it 
waa bat policy to shew them, what 
a harmless pleasaut fellow 1 am 
in order to familiarize the John' 
and the Joseph's tome, Foritwa 
'evident to me, by the good wo 
man's calling them down, that 
■he thought ne a dangerous man. 
Whereas now, John and I have 
ihaken hands together, and daiae 
Smith having seen that I have the 
fkee, and hands, and looks of a 
man, and walk uprieht,and prate, 
Ud Utigh, and joke, like other 
yeople; and Joseph, that I can

talk of taking his teeth out of his 
head, without doiug him the least 
hurt; they will all, at my next 
visit, be much more easy and plea- 
sant with me than Andrew's cloves 
were to him; and we shall ne as 
thoroughly acquainted, as if we 
had known one another a twelve- 
month. 

When I returned to our mo- 
ther's, I again cursed her, and all 
our nymphs together, and still re- 
fused to see either Sally or Polly. 
I raved at the horrid arrest; and 
told the old draeou, that it was 
lowing to her and hers, that the 
ifairest virtue in the world was 
ruined; my reputation for ever 
blasted; and that I was not mar- 
ried , and happy in the love of the 
most excellent of ber sex. 

She, to pacify me. said, she 
would shew me a n 
would please me; si 
not see Sally who v 
grief. 

Where is this new face? cried 
I: let me see her, though I shall 
never see any face with pleasure 
but Miss Harlowe's. 

She won't come down, replied 
she. She will not be at the word 
of command yet. She is but just 
in the trammels; and must be 
waited upon, I'll assure you; and 
courted much besides. 

Aye! said 1, that looks well. 
Lead me to her the instant. 

1 followed her up: and who 
should she be , but that little toad 
Sally 1

hive heard my story. You are i 
admirer of the most excellent 
vomaa in the world. Dear Mia. 
Lovick, tell me what is become of 
her? 

The poor lady, sir, went out 
yesterday, on purpose to avoid 

How so? She knew not that I 
would be here. 

She was aJTsid you would come 
when she heard you wore re- 
covered from your illness. Ah ! sir, 
what pity if ia that bo fine agen*

Yoa are an excellent womsji,

if she will have it ao, Iwill never

Sir, said the widow, it would be 
death for her to see you. She was 
at home last nigbt^ I'll tell yoa

die; and if she could not a^oid 
your visit, she was uuable to ily

Why, sir, she rested not two 
hours , for fear of you. Her fear 
gave her strength, which she'll 
suffer for, when that fear is over. 
And finding herself, the more she 
thought of your visit, the less able 
to stay to receiveit, she took chair, 
and is gone nobody knows whither. 
Hut, 1 believe , she intended to be 
carried to the water-side, in order 
to take boat; for she cannot bear 
acoach. It eitremelj incommoded 
her yesterday. 

But before we talk any further, 
said I, ifshe be gone abroad, yon 
can have no objection to my look- 
ing into every apartment above 
and below; because I :un told she 
is actually m the house. 

Indeed, sir, she lis II nf. You may 
satisfy yourself, if you please; 
but Mrs. Smith and I waited on 
her to her chair. We were forced 
to support her, she was so weak. 
She said , Whither can I go , Mrs, 
Lovick? whither coii 1 go, Mrs. 
Smith? — Cruel, cruel man! — 
Tell him I called him so, if he 
come again! God give him that 
peace which be denies me ! 

Sweet creature! cried I, and 
looked down, and took out my 
handkerchief. 

The widow wept. I wish, i^ 
she, 1 had never known aoo^- 
leut a lady, and so gieaXiw^hmt 
I love her as my own cbildf 

Mrs. Smith wept

no si^na of an tmrnmil;/, but, con-

ease the overcharged heart, which 
would burst but for that kindly 
and natural relief. 



WbitperM iL a'gr-fraug!.l iean, o»il biii,

usedst to take pleasure in repeti- 
tions from the poets; but thon 
must be tasteless of their beauties 
uowi^etbo not diacomitenanced 
by this uncouth and unreflecting 
Mowbray, for, as Juvenal says, 
Tears are the prerogative ofman- 

'Tia, at least, seasonably said, 
my dear Belford. It is kind to 
keep ine in countenance for this 
leiimanish weakiiesx, as Mowbray 
has been upbraidingly calling it, 
ever since lie has been with me: 
and in so doiii^ (whatever I might 
have thought in such hi^h health 
as he enjoys) has convinced me, 
that bottle friends feel nothing 
but what moves in that little 

Well, well, uroeeed in your own 
way, Jack. I love my friend Bel- 
ton as well as you can do ; yet for 
the blood of me, I cannot but 
think, that soothing a man's 
weakness is incroaaing it 

If it be a weakness, to be 
touched at sreat and concerning 
eventa, in which our humanity is 
concerned, saidl, thoumayeatbe 
right.

more delight to talk of the living

the dying Belton and his repeD-

that worst of all, to last beyond

what will he then think of the

attention? Tell him, dearBelford, 
tell him, how happy he is, if he 
knows bis own happiness; how 
happy, compared to hia poor 
dying friend, that he has re-

still an opportunity lent him, for 
which I would give a thousand 
■worlds, had I them to give ! " 

I approved exceedingly of his 
reflections, as suited to his present 
ciicumstances: and inferred con- 
solations to him from a mind so 
properly (ouched. 

He proceeded in the like peni- 
tent strain. I have lived a very 
wicked life: ao have weall. We 
have never made a conacience of 
doing whatever miachief either 
force or fraud enabled us to do.

one day feel, if it be wbut Inow

evila before thee, and with thee, 
are more than the effects of imagi- 
nation. 

I was called twice oo Sunday 
night to him; for the poor fellow, 
when his reflections on his past 
life annoy him most, is a&aid of 
being left with the woi 
his eyes, they IcU me, huatand 
roll about for me. Where's Mr.

out, cries he — yet begofhimto 
step to me — yet don't — yet do; 
were once the doubting and 
changeful orders he gave; and 
they called me accordingly. 

But. alas! what could Belfoid 
dofornim? Belford, who had been 
but too often the companion of his 
guilty hours; who wants merey 
as much as he does, and is unable 
to promise it to hintself, though 
'tis all he can bid his poor friend 
rely upon. 

What miscteantsarewe! What 
figures shall we make in t' 
terrible hours !

THB HIBTOEY OP 



Bclf in my compauy, for [the first 
partofthenight: Adrowningman 
wUl cateh at astraiB, the proverb 
well says: anil a straw was I, with 
respect to any real help I could 
give him. He often awaked in 
terrors; and once calling out for 
me, Dear Belford, said he, where 
are you? — Oh! there you ai-e! — 
Give me your friendly handl — 
Then grasping it, and patting his 
clainmy,half coldlips toit — How 
kind! — I fear every thing when 
you a^e absent. But the presence 
ofafriend, a sympathising friend 

— oh ! how comfortable ! 

But about four in the morning 
he frighted me much: he waked 
with fliree terrible groans; and 
endeavoured to speak, but could 
not presently — and when he did, 

— Jack, Jack, Jack, five or sis 
times repeated he as quick as 
thought, now, now, now, save me, 
save me, save me — 1 am going — 
going, indeed! 

1 threw my arms about him, and 
raised bim up on his pillow, as he 
was sinking (as iftoliide himself) 
in the bed-clothes — and staring 
wildly, Where am I? said he, a 
little recoverins. Did you not see 
him? turning his head this way 
and that; horror in his counten- 
ance; Didyounot seehim? 

See whom, see what, my dear 
Helton! 

O lay me upon the bed again! 
cried he. — Let me not die upon 
the floor ! — Lay me down gently 
and stand hyme!— Leavemenot 

— All, all wilt soon be over! 
You are already, my dear 

Beltoa, upon the bed. You have 



not been upon the floor. This 
a Btroog delirium; you are faint 
for want of refreshment [for hehaii 
"refused several times to take . — 
Lhing]; let me persuade vou 
take some of this cordial julep, 
will leave you, if you will 

He then readily took it; bn 
said he could have sworn th 
Tom Metcalfe had been in tl 
room, and had draws him onti 
bed by the throat, upbraiding hi 
with the injuries heliad first doi 
his sister, and then him, in ti 
duel to which he owed that tef 
which cost him his life. 

Thou knoweet the story, Lova 
lace, too well, to need my repeat

and slept several boors moi

two past days and nights, thou; 
he had sleeping draughts gin 
him before. But it is more u 
more evident every hoar, Ujl 
nature is almoiit worn out in hin 

Mowbray, quite tired with tb 
houseof mourning, intends tos

was not a little rejoiced to neaijri 



rWe i 



He has just taken leave of bii 
poor friend, intending to go aw&y 
ettrly: an everlasting leave,! maj 
venture to say; tor I think he 
will hardly live till t 
night, 

i believe the poor roan would 
not have been sorry had he U 
him when I arrived; for 'tis 
ehocking creature, and enjoys t< 
strong health to know how to pity 
the Bick. Then (to borrow an 
observation from thee) he has, by 
nature , strong bodily orgaus, 
wbicti those of his soul i 
likely to whet out; and he, 
as the wicked friend be is going 
to,inay last a great while from thi 
strength of their constitutions 
though 80 greatly different in their 
talents; if neither the aword 
the halter interpose. 

I mnst refieat , that I cannot but 
be very uneasy for the poor lady 
whom you eo cruelly persecute; 
and that I do not think you have 
kept your honour with me. I was 
apprehensive, indeed, tliat you 
would attempt to see her, as soon 
as you got well enough to come 
up; and 1 told her as much, mak- 



ing I 



i of it 



prepai;^ her for your visit , and to 
induce her to stand it. Bat she 
could DOt, it is ^lain, bear the 
shock of it: and mdeed she told 
me, that she would not see you, 
though but for one half-hour, for 
the world. 

Could she have prevailed upon 
hem^, I kaom that the sight of 



135 

her would have been as affecting 
to you, as your visit could have 
been to her; when you had seen 
to what a lovely skeleton (for she is 
really lovely still, nor can she, with 
suchaform and features, be other- 
wise) you have, in a few weeks, 
reduced one of the most charming 
women iu the world; and that in 
the fnll bloom of her youth and 
beauty. 

Mowbray undertakes to carry 
this, that he may be more welcome 
to yon, he says. Were it to be 
sent unsealed, the characters we 
would be Hebrew to the 
dunce. 1 desire you to return it; 
and I'll give you a copy of it upon 
demand; forlintend tokeepitby 
— " as a guard against the infec- 
f your c mp any , which might 
otherwise, perhaps, some time 
be apt to weaken the im- 
pressions I always desire to have

convert us both !

treat them with kindness , and do

I dispatcbed instantlj a letter 
to the dear creature , assuring lier, 
with the most thankful joy, '"fhat 
T would directly set out for Herks, 
and wait the issue of the happy 
reconciliation, and the charmiue 
hopes abe had filled me with. J 

5ou[ed out upon ber a thousand 
iesaings. 1 declared that it should 
be the study of my whole life to 
merit such transcendent goodness: 
and that there was nothing which 
her father or friends ahouldrequire 
at my hands, thatlwould not for 
heraaike comply with, in order to 
promote andcomplete sodesirable 
a reconciliation." 

I hurried it away without taking 
a copy of it; and 1 have ordered 
the chariot- and- six to be got 
ready; andhcy for M. Hall! Let 
me but know how Belton does. 1 
hope a letter from thee is on the 
road. And if the poor fellow can 
spare thee, make baste, I com- 
maud thee, to attend this truly 
divine lady. Thou may'st not else 
see her of months perhaps; at 
least not while she is Miss Hab- 
LoWE. And oblige me, ifpoBBible, 
with one letter before she sets out, 
confirming to me and accounting 
for this generous change. 

But what accounting for it 
necessary? The dear creature 
cannot receive consolation herself 
but she must commoiiioate it to 
others. How noble! She would 
not see me in her adversity; hot 
2IO Booaei doeu the suu of pro- 



sperity begin to shine Upon her, 
than sne forgives me. 

1 know to whose mediation all 
thia is owing. It is to Col. Mor-

loved and honoured him! And 
he loved her above all hia rela- 

I shall now be eonviiiced that 
there is something ia dreams. The 
opening cloud is the reconcilia- 
tion in view. The bright form, 
lifting up my charmer throngh it 
to a nrmament stuck round with 
golden cherubims and seraphiiOB,

of this happy reconciliation. Tha 
welcomes, tbnce lepeated, an- 
those of herfamily, tiownomon' 
to be deemed implacable. Yet lire-

Letme tell thee, Jack, that so 
much am 1 pleaded with this world 
in the main; though iDsomepoints 
too , the world (to make a person 
of it) has been a rascal to me; so 
delighted am I with the joys of 
youth ; with my worldly prospects 
as to fortune, and now, newly, 
with the charming hopes giveu 
me by my dear, thrice dear, and 
for ever dear Ci.a.BissA ! thatnere 
I even sure that nothing bad 
would come hereafter, 1 should be 
very loth (very much afraid, if 
thou wilt have it so) to lay down 
my life and them together; and 
yet, upon a call of honour,no man 
fears death less than myself. 

Butlhave not either inclination 
or leisure to weigh thy if arfen argu- 
ments, except m the I'll/, or, aa 
thou wouldest say, in the lump. 

If 1 return thy letters, let me 
have them again sometime hence, 
that is to say, when I am married, 
or when poor Belton is half for- 
gotten; or when time has enrolled 
the honest fellow among those 
whom we have to long lost, that 
we mayremember them with more 
pleasure than pain; and then I 

ay give them a serious perusal,

thou wilt into the subject.

the dear creature has avoided my 
visit. Things are now in so good 
atr.iin that 1 must forgive tlieei 
else thou shouldst have heard 
more of this new instance of dis-

Thou art continually giving 
thyself high praise, byway of op-

gently and artfully blaming Ihy sel f 
for qualities thou wouldst, at the 
same time, have to be thought, 
and which generally are thought, 
praiseworthy. 

Thus , in the airs thou assumest 
about thy servants, thou wouldst 
pass for a mighty humane mortal ; 
and that at the expense of Mow- 
bray and me, whom thou repre- 
sentest as kings and emperors to

imhappy in thy attempts of this 
kind, and never canst make us,

quy) to help on a sorry plot, or to 
bring about a necessary eclair- 
cissement, to save the poet the 
trouble of thinking deeplj; for a 
butter way to wind up his bot- 

Of this 1 am persuaded (what- 
ever my jirocfiii' be to my own 
servants) that tliou wilt be bene- 
fited by my Miw^, when we come 
to controvert the point. For then 
I shall convince thee, that the tira- 
innlic as well as natural characte- 
ristics of a good servant ought to 
be fidelity, common sense, cheer- 
full obedience, and silent respect: 
that wit in liis station, except to 
his companioua, would be sau- 
cinesa : that he should never pre- 
sume to give his advice: that if 
he ventured to espostulate upon 
any unreasonable command, or 
such a one as appeared to bimto 
be so, he should do it with humi- 
lity and respect, and take a 
E roper season for it. But such

performances I have seen, ^ve,

As soon as I had seen Mowbray

poor Belton; whom I found in 
dreadful agonies, in which he 
awoke, aahe generally does. 

The doctor came iu presently 
after; and I was concerned at 
the scene that passed between 

It opened with the dying man's 
asking him, with melancholy 
earnestness, if nothing, if no- 
thing at all could be done for 
him? 

The doctor shook his bead, and 
told him, he doubted not. 

I eanniil die, said the poor man; 
I cannot f/iink of dying, I am ve^r 
deairoDs of living a little longer, if 
I coulil but be free from these 
horrible pains in my stomach and 
head. Can you give me no thing

Alas! sir, replied his phy'sici an,

I fear, I fear nothing in physic can 
help you. 

He was then out of all patience. 
What, then, is your art, sirl — I

whole twelvemonth, to be wrought 
upon at the pleanure of you people

Sir, continued he fiercely (and 
with more strength of voice, and 
coherence, than he had shewn for 
several hours before), if you give 
me over, I give you over. — The

what do ye do, when called in, 
but nurse our distempers, till from 
pigmiea you make giants of them?

The doctor was out of coun- 
tenance; but said, if we could 
make mortal men imvtorlal, and 
minilil. iiot, ali this might be just. 

I blamed the poor man; yet ex- 
cused him to the physician. To 
die, dear doctor, when, like my 
poor friend, we are so desirous of 
life, ia a melancholy thing. We 
are apt to hope too much, not con- 
sidering that the seeds of death 
are sown in us when we begin to 
liTe, and grow up, till, like ram- 
~iant weeds, they choke tiie tender 

lower of life; which declines in

and not , when the flower or plaij 
is withered at the root, and th 
weed in its full vigour, expect 
that the medical art will reBtt-^ 
the one, or destroy the othi 
when that other, as I hinted, h 
been rooting itself in the hal 
from the time of our birth. 

This speech, Bob, thon wilt ci

Thou art releaaed from insuffer- 
able tortures, both of body and 
mind! May those tortures, ' 
thy repentance, expiate for 
offences, and mayest thou 
h^py to all eteruity! 

We are told, that God desireth

of a sinner: and 'tis certain, that 



in the midst of thy sins, by the 
sword of injured Jriendship, which 
more than once thou hadat braved

no opjjortunity for repentancej, 
that this is a merciful earnest that 
thy penitence is accepted; and 
that thy long illness, and dreadful 
agonies, in the last stages of ' 
were thy only punishment. 



I wish, indeed, I hearlilij wish, 
we could have seenone ray of com- 
fort darting in upon his benighted 
miiid,befoTe he departed. But all, 
alas! to the very last gasp, was 
horror and confusion, ind my 
oiily fear arises from this, that, 
till within the fourlast dayaof his 
life, he could not be hrouKbt t« 
think he should 'die, though in a 
visible decline for months; and, 
in that presumption, was too little 
inclineatoset about a serious pre- 

Earation for a journey, which he 
oped he should not bo obliged to 
take ; and when he began to a]>- 
prehend that ho could not put it 
otf, his impatience, and terror, 
and apprehension, shewed too 
little of that reliance and resigna- 
tion, which afford the most com- 
fortable reflections to the frieiids 
of the dying, as well as to the 
ilying themselves. 

But we must leave poor Belton 
to that merey , of which we have 
all so much need; and, for my 
nvni part (doyou, Lovelace, and 
the rest of the fraternity, as ye 
will) I am rcsolvedlwill endeavour

hope, however, that he is happy: 
andlhave the more hope, becaoai 
the hardness of his death is likely 
to be such a warning to Oiee. If it 
have the effect thou declarest it

heart would break as she 
came down stairs, and as she went 
through the shop into the coach, 
her nurse with, her, as you had 
informed me before: that she 
ordered the coachman (whom she 
hired for the day) to drive any 
whither, so itwas into the air: he 
accordingly drove her to Hamp- 
stead, ana thence to Highgate. 
There at the Bowling-green 
House she alighted , exti'emely ill, 
and having breakfasted, ordered 
the coachman to drive veryslowly 
any whither. He crept along to 
Mttswell Kill, and put up at a 
public house there; where she 
employed herself two hours in 
writing, though exceedingly weak 
and low; till the dinner she had 
ordered was brought in: she en- 
deavoured to eat, butcouldnot;

gone, she said. And then she 
wrote on for three hours more; 
after which, being heavy, she 
dozed a little in an elbow chair. 
When she awoke, she ordered 
the coachman to drive her very 
slowly to town, to the house of a 
friend of Mrs. Loviuk; whom, as 
agreed upon, she met there: but. 
being extremely ill, she would 
venture liome at a late hour, al- 
though she heard from the widow, 
thatyou had been there; and had 
reason to be shocked at your be- 
haviour. She said, she found 
there was no avoiding yon: she 
was apprehensive she should not 
live many hours, aud it was not 
impossible but the shock the sight 
of you must give her, would de- 
termine her fate in your pre- 

"She accordingly went home. - 
She heard the relation of your 
astonishing vagaries, with bands 
and eyes often lifted up; and 
with these words intermingled, 
Shocking creature! Incorrigible

him serious? And not bein^ able 
to bear the thoughts of an mter-

took to her usual chair early in 
the morning, and was carried to 
the Temple -stairs, whither she 
had ordered her nurse before her, 
to get a pair of oars in readiuess 
(for her f'atieues the day before

and then she was rowed to

Eat in, and drank tea at a house

and returned to the Temple: and 
when she landed, made one of the 
watermen get her a chair, and so 
was earriea to the widow's friend, 
BB the nigbt before; where she 
again met the widow, who 
formed her, that you ' -^ ■- 
after her twice that day. 

"Mrs. Lovick gave her there 
her siater'a letter*; and ihe was 
BO much affected with the con- 
tenta of it, that she was twice 
Tery nigh fainting away; and 
wept bitterly, as Mrs. Lovicki 
told Mrs. Smith; dropping some 
warmer expreEsions tban ever 
they had heard proceed from her 
lipfl, ia relation to her friends; 
calling them cruel, and complain- 
ing ot ill offlocs done her, and of 
vile reports raised against her. 

" Wnile she was thua disturbed, 
Mrs. Smith came to her , and told 
her, that you had been there a| 
third time, and was just gone, (at| 
half an hour after nine) having left 
word how civil and respectfitl you I 
would be; but that you was deter- ! 
mined to see her at all events. 

"She said, it was hard she 
could not be permitted to die in 
peace: that her lot was a severe 
one: that she began to be afraid 
she should not forbear repining, 
and to think her punishment 



greater than her fault: but re- 
calling herself immediately, she 
comforted herself that her life 
would be short, and with the as- 
surance of a better." 

By what 1 have mentioned, yon 
will conclnde with me, that the 
letter brought her by Sbs. Lovick 
(the superscription of which you 
saw to ce written in her Bister's 
bund) could not be the letter on 
the contents ofwhichehegrounded

Lovick, nor Mrs. Smith, nor the 
servant of the latter, know of any

women assured me, that she actu-

of a suspicion which I had began 
to entertaiu, that you (for some 
purpose I could not guess at) had 
forged the letter from her of which 
you sent me a copy. 

On Wednesday morning, wbcm 
she received your letter in answer 
to hers, she said, Necessity may 
well be called the mother of in- 
vention — but calamity is the test 
of integrity. — I hope I have not 
taken an ineicusable step — and 
there she stopt a minute or two; 
and then said, 1 shall no w, perhaps,

hope that any thing serious or

We had some talk about Bel- 
ton's dying behaviour, and I gave 
her several patticulara of the poor 
man's impatience and deapair; to 
which Bhewasvoryattcntive; and 
made fine obsei'vations upon the 
Bubjeet of procrastination. 

A letter and packet were 
brought her by a man on horse- 
back from Misa IIowc, while we 
were talking. She retired up 
stairs to read it ; and while I was 
in diacourse with Iilrs. Smith and 
Mrs. Lovick , the doctor and apo- 
thecary both came in together. 
They confirmed to me my fears, 
as to the dangerous way she is in. 
They had both been apprised of 
the new instances of implacable- 
ness in her friends, and of your 

Eersecutions : and the doctorsaid, 
e would not for the world be 
either the unforgiving father of 
that lady, or the man who had 
brought her to this distresa. Her 
hearrs broken: she'll die, aaid he: 
there is no saving her. But how, 
were 1 either the one or the other 
of the people 1 have named, I 
should Bupport myself afterwards 
I cannot tell. 

When she was told we were all 
three together, she desired us to

walk up. She 

three generalqueBtions relating 
her health, she addressed herself 
to ua, to the following effect: 

As I maj not , said she, see you 
three gentlemen together again, 
let me take this opportunity to 
acknowledge my obligations to 
youall. I am inexpresBibly obliged 
to you, sir, and to you, air, [conrt- 
seying to the doctor and to Mr. 
Goddard], for your fnitre than 
friendly, yoai jiatemid tare and 
concern for me. Hamanity in 
your profession , I daresay, is far 
from being a rare iiualification, 
because you are gentlemen E^ your 
profsBsioD: but so much kindness, 
BO much humanity, did never 
desolate creature meetwith, asl 
have met withfromyonbotb. But, 
indeed, I have always observed, 
that where a person relies upon 
ProvidencCj it never fails to raise 
up a new fnend for every old one 
that falls off. 

This gentleman [bowing to me] 
who, Bome people think, should 
have been one of the last 1 should 
have thought of for my eseeutor 
— is nevertheless (such is the 
strange turn that things have 
taken!) the only one I can choose; 
and therefore I have chosen him 
for that charitable office, and he 
has been so good as Co accept of it: 
for, rich asl may boast myself to 
be, I am rather so in liijJit, than in 
fad, at this present. I repeat 
therefore my numble thanks to 
you all three, and beg of God to

to each] an hundredfold, the kind- 
ness and favour you have shewn 
me; and that it may be in the 
power of youaudofyours, to the 
end of time, to confer benefits, 
rather than to be obliged toreceie* 
them. This ia a godlike power, 
gentlemen: I once rejoiced in itin 
some little degree; and much more 
in the prospect I had of its being 
enlarged to me; though I have 
had the mortification to experience 
the reverse, and to be obliged 
almost to every body I have seen 



bear the punishment without 
repining: and I hope I do. — Por-

wishes for, to express itself suit-

ness to me; and Ood Almigh^

She retired from us to her closet 
with her eyes full; and left lU 
looking upon one another. 

Wenad hardly recovered ow- 
sclveB,wheD she, quite easy.cbeer- 
ful, and smiling, returned to no.

They both hesitated, and looked 
upon each other. Don't be afraid 
to answer me, said she, each sweet 
hand pressing upon the arm of

She then retired, witha cheerful

Tbus, Lovelace, it is plain, that 
she means to bespeak ber last

here's tranqnilhty of heart, on the 
most affecting occasion! — This 
is magnanimity indeed 1 — Couldst 
thou, or could I, with all oar 
boisterous bravery, and offensive 
false courage, act thus? — Poor 
Bekon, bow unlike was thy be-

Mrs. Lovick tells me, that the 

lady spoke of a letter she had 

received from her favourite divine 

Dr. Lewin, in the time of my ah- 

id of an answer she had 

returned to it. But Mrs. Lovick 

knows not the contents of either. 

When thou receivest the letter

rived, and resolves to have justice 
done you. 

A consideration which ought to 
affect your conscience [forgiveme, 
deareat young lady, I think I am 
now in too way of my duty] ; and 
tobeof more concern to you, than 
that hard pressure upon your 
modesty which I know the ap- 
pearance against him in an open 
coartmuatbeof to such a lady as 
you; and which, I conceive, will 
be your great diffictdty. But I 
know, madam, that you have 
dignity enough to become the 
blushes of the most naked truth, 
when necessity, justice, and ho- 
nour, eiact it from you. Rakes 
and ravishers would meet with 
encouragement indeed, and most 
from those who had the greatest 
abhorrence of their actions, if 
violated modesty were never to 
complain of the injury it received 
fromthevillainDuaatteropteraofit, 

In a word, the reparation of your 
family disbonoui' now rests in your 
own bosom: and which only one 
of these two alternatives can re- 
pair; to wit, either to many the 
offender, or to prosecute liim at 
law. Bitter expedients for a soul 
so delicate as yoursl 

He and nil hia friends, I under-

it Is certainly, now, all the amends

To pretend to pardon, while wi

however injured and oppressed, 
remains unshaken in lier sen- 
timents of honour and virtue: and 
although she would sooner die 
than ilmeive that her modesty 
should be drawn into question; 
yet she will think no truth im- 
modest that is to be uttered in the 
vindiiratcd cause of innocence and 
cbaa^. Little, retj littie di^ 



ference is there , my dear youn^ 
lady, between a suppressed evi- 
dence, and false one. 

li is a terrible circumstance, I 
once more own, for a young lady 
of your delicacy, to be under tba 
obligation of telling so shocking 
a story in public court: but it u 
still a worse imputation, that she 
should pass over so mortal an in- 
jury unresented. 

Conscience, honour, justice, are 
on your side: and modesty would, 
by some, bethought but an empty 
unme, should ynu refuse to obey 
their dictates, 

I have been couEulted, I own, 
on this subject. I have given it 
as my opinion, that you ou^t to 
prosecute the abandoned man — ■■

reserved, with a resolution to lay 
them before yon unknown to any: 
body, that the result, if what 7 
wish, may be your num. 

I will only' add, that the iiu«- 
fortunes which have befallen Tou, 
had they been the lot of a child of' 
my own, could not have affectedi 
me more than yours have done. 
My own child 1 love: but 1 both' 
love and honour you: since to IotO' 
you, is to love virtue, good sense, 
prudence, and every thing that is 
good and noble in woman. 

Wounded as 1 think all tbeaV

ceived, you will believe that the 
knowledge of your distresses must

able to express,

grief and what punishment are 
ley not treasuring up against 
tbemselres iu the heavy reflections 
which theu7 rash censures and un-

But I find to what your uncle 
Antony's cruel letter is owing, as 
welt as one you will be still more 
afflicted by, [God help you my poor 
dear child ! ] when it comes to your 
hand , written by your sister, with 
proposals to you*. 

It was finished to send you 
yesterday, 1 know; and I apprise 
you of it, that you should fortify 
your heart against the contents 
of it. 

The motiveswhich incline them 
all to this severity , if well 
grounded, would authorize any 
severity they could express, and 
tvliich, while they believe them to 
be so. both they and you are to be 
equally pitied. 

They are owin^ to the informa- 
tion of that officious Mr. Brand, 
who has acquainted them (from 
someenemy of youra in the neigh- 
bourhood about you{ that viaits 
are made yon, highly censurable, 
by a man of a free character, and

But. SUnrdm; . Aug. 36. 

Tub generosity of your purpose 
would have commanded not oniy 
ny notice, but my tbaiiks, al- 
though you had iiol given me the 
iltemaUve you are pleased to call 
srlfiil. And I do therefore give 

Su my thanks for your kind 
ter. 

At the time you distinguished 
me by your favourable opinion, I 
toldyon, sir, that my choice was 
Ihe single life. And moat Indy 
did I tefi you bo. 

When that was not permitted 
toe, and 1 looked round upon the 
M^veral gentlemen who bad been 
^posed to me , and had reason 
to believe that there was not one 
cf tbem agaiust whose morals or 
[irineiples there lay not si/rns ai- 
i^tion, it would not have been 
I'arito be wondered at, ifFiMCv 
kJ been allowed to give a pre- 
torence, where Juqohent was at 
»1qm to determine. 

Far be it from me to say tbia 
sithadesign to upbraid you, sir, 
M to reflect upon you. I always 
«Tshed you well. You had reason 
tolbitikl did, You had the gcue- 
'uaity tobe pleasednith the frank- 
nmsof my Dehaviour toyou; as I 
W with that of yours tome: and 



179 

I am sorry, very sorry, to be now 
told, that the acquiescence yoa 
obliged me with gave you so much 

Hadtheoptionlhavementioned 
been allowed me nftencards (as I 
not only wished but proposed) 
things had not happened that did 
happen. But there was a kind of 
fatality by which our whole family 
was impelled , as I may say ; and 
which none of us were permitted to 
avoid. But this is a subject that 
eannot be dwelt upon. 

As matters are, I have only to 
wish, for your own sake , that you 
will encourage and cultivate those 
good motions in your mmd, to 
which mauy passages in your kind 
and generous letter, now before 
me, must be owing. Depend upon 
It, sir, that such motions, wrought 
into habit, will yield you pleasure 
at a lime when nothing else can. 
And at jire.'en/, shining out in your 
actions and couvetsationj will 
commend Tou to the worthiest of 
our sex. For, sir, the man who is 
good upon choice, as well as by 
education, fasa that quality in him- 
self, which ennobles the human 
race, and without which the most 
dignified by birth or rank are 
ignoble. 

As to the resolution you so 
solemnly make, not to marry while 
I live, I should he concerned at it, 
were I not morally sure , that yon 
may keep it, and yet not be de- 
trirnented by it: since a few, a 
very few days, will convince you, 
that 1 am got above all human 
dependence; and that there is no

I 



Abodt the time of poor Belton'a 
interment last night, as near as we 
could guBBB, LocdM., Mowbray, 
and myself, toasted once. To the 
memory of honestTomBellntii and, 
by a quick tranaitioa to the living, 
HealOi to Miss Harloiee; which 
LordM.obligingly began, and, To 
(fia iappv reconciliation; and then 
we stuck in a remembrance. To 
finnest Jack Belford , who, oflate, 
we all agreed, is become an naeful 
and humaue man; and one who 
prefers his frieud'e service to liis 

But what is the meaning I hear 
nothing from thee?* And why 
dost thou not let me into the 
grounds of the sudden reconcilia- 
tion between my beloved and lier 
friends, and the cause of the ge- 
nerous invitation which she gives 
me of attending her at herfatner's 
some time hence? 

Thou must certainly have been 
let into the secret by this time; 
and I can tell thee, I shall he 
plaguy jealous if there be any one 
thing pass between my angel and 
thee, that is to be concealed from 



me. For either I am a principal 
in this cause, or I am nothing. 

I have dispatched Will to Know 
the reason of thy neglect. 

But, let me whisper a word or 
two in thy ear. 1 begin to be 
afraid, after all, that this letter 
was a stratagem to get me ont of 
town, and tor nothing else; for, 
in the fiist place. Tourville, ins 
letter I received this morning, 
tells me, that the lady is actnalhr 
very ill [1 am sorry for it with all 
m^soullj This, thou'lt say, Im&7 
think a reason why she cannot set 
out as yet: but then I have heard, 
on the other Land , hut last nigh t^ 
that the family is as implacable as 
; and my lord and I eipeet 
veiT afternoon a visit from 
ColonelMorden; who under takes, 
it seems, to question me as tonn' 
intention with regard to bit 




This convinces me , that if she 
has apprised her friends of m^ 
oflers to her , they will not beliera 
me to be in earnest , till they aroc 
assured that I am so from my owa 
mouth. But then I understand,' 
that the intended visit is an of' 
ficiousness of Morden's own, 
without the desire of any of }ifT 
friends. 

Now, Jack, what can a man 
make of all this? My intelligence, 
as^ to the continuance of her fa- 
mily's imp] acahleness, is not to be 
doubted; and yet when I read' 
her letter, what can one say? — ■" 
Surely, the dear little roguewill

thought be would ever have ex-

Thomaaine, they told me, in a 
kindof disguise, was in anobscure 
pew, out of curiosity (for it seems 
she was far Irom shewing auy 
tokens of grief) to see the last 
office performed for the man whose 
heart she had so largely contri- 
bnted to break. 

I waa obliged to stay till this

me, that if now, or at any trnie

invoked a bleaaing npon me for 
my goodness, as she called it , to a 
desolate creature, who suffered

were her words. 

She then went back to her first

your molesting her again; and 
said, If you have any in^uence

Ab soon OS I had dispatched m; 
servant to you with my letter of 
the 2Cth, 28th, and yesterday the 
29th, I went to pay my duty to 
her, and had the pleasure to find 
her, ttfter a tolerable nicht, pretty 
lirdy and cheerful. She was hnl 
just returned from her usual de- 
rotions. And Doctor H. alighted 
Be she entered the door. 

After inquiring how she did, 
and hearing her complaints of 
•hortneaa of breath, (which she 
*ttrilHiled to inward decay, preci- 
pitated by her late harasses, as 
well from tier friends as from you) 
he was for advising her to go into 

What will that do for mo? Baid 
ahe; tell me truly, good sir, with a 
eheerfnl aspect, (you know you 
cannot disturb mo oy it) whether 
now you do not put on 
physician; and, despairing that 
any thing in medicine will help 
me, adrise me to the air, as the 
last resource? — Can you think 
the air will avail in such a malady 
•amine? 

He was silent, 

1 ask, said she, because my 
£riend3 (who wilt possibly some 
time hence inquireafter the means 
1 used for my recovery) may be 
satisfied that 1 omitted nothing 
which HO worthy and so skilful a! 
I prescribed. I 

inndam, may possibly'

help the difGcultr of breathing, 
which has so lately attacked you. 

liut, sir, you see how weak lam. 
You must see that I have been 
consumiug from day today; and 
now, if I can judge oy what I feel 
in myself, putting her hand to her 
heart, I cannot eontinne long. If 
the air would very probably add 
to my days, though I am far from 
being ih'sirotis to have them leng- 
thened, 1 would go into it; and 
the rather, as 1 know Mrs. Lovick 
would kindly accompany me. But 
if I were to be at the trouble of 
removing into new lodgings, (a 
trouble which I think now would 
be too much for me) and this only 
to die in the country , I bad rather 
the scene were to be shut up here. 
For here have I meditated the 
spot, and the manner, and every 
thing, as well of the minutest as 
of the highest consequence, that 
can attend the solemn moments. 
So, doctor, tell me truly, may 
I stay here, and be clear of 
any impatations of curtuling, 
through wilfulness or impatience, 
or through resentments , which I 
hope I am got above, a life that 
miffht otherwise he prolonged? — 
Tell me, sir; you are not talking 
to a coward in this respect; 'in- 
deed you are not! — Unaffectedly

at a loss what to say, lifting up 
bis eyes only in admiration of

rectly, I will pat it in other words 
— you don't enjiiin me to go into 
the air, doctor, do youV 

I do no(, madflm. Nor do I now 
visit yoii as a pbyaician ^ but as a 
person whose conversatioD I ad- 
mire , and whose sufleriugs 1 con- 
dole. And to explain myself more 
directly , as to the occasion of this 
day's visit in particular, I must 
tell jou, madam, that, under- 
Btanding how much jou suffer by 
the displeasure of your friends; 
and having no doubt, but that if 
they knew the way you are in, 
they would alter their conduct to 
you; and believing it moat cut 
them to the heart, when, too late, 
they shall be informed of every 
thing; 1 have resolved to apprise 
them by letter (etratiger as I am 
to their peraons) how necessary it 
is for some of them to attend you 
very speedily. For fheir aaies, 
madam, let me press for your ap- 
probation of this measure. 

She paused; and at last said. 
This is Kind, very kind in you, sir. 
But I hope that you do not think 
me so perverse, and bo obstinate, 
as to have left till now any means 
unessayed, which 1 thought likely 
to move my friends in my favour. 
But, doctor, I should now be too 
much disturbed at their grief, if 
they were any of them to come or 
to send to me; and perhaps, if I 
found they still loved me, wishto 
live; and so should quit unwil- 
lingly that life, which I am non 
really fond of quitting , and hop( 
to quit , as becume.s a person wVk 
has had such a weaning time as I 
hare been favoured with 



I hope, madam, said I, you art 
.. jt so near as you apprehend, t* 
that deplorable catastrophe youi 
hint at with such an amaKing pre- 
sence of mind. And therefore I 
presume to second the doctor'! 
motion, if it were only for the' 
sake of your father and motho^' 
that they may have the satisfao-; 
tion, if they mutt lose you, 
think , they were first reconciled' 
to you. 

It is veiT kindly, very humanely 
considered, said she. But if votf

intended interview with Mr. Love- 
lace is over; of which, perhaps, 
Mr. Belford,your next letters mav 
give an account? I hope it will 
not be a fatal one to any body. 
Will you promise me, doctor, 
to forbear writing for two days 
only, and I will communicate to 
you any thing that occurs in that 
and then you shall lak^ 
your own way? Meantime, Ire-

He came on horseback, at- 
tended b^ one servant; and Lord 
M. received him, as a relation of 
Miss Harlows's, with the highest 
marks of civility aud respect. 

After tiome general talk of the 
times, and ot the weather, and 
such nonsense as Englishmen ge- 
nerally make their introductory 
topics to conversation, the colonel 
addressed himself to Lord M. and 
to me, as follows : 

I need not, my lord, and Mr. 
Lovelace, as you know the rela- 
tion t bear to the Harlowe family, 
make any apology for entering 
upon a subject, which, on account 
01 that relation, you must think 
is the principal reason of the 
honour 1 1 

Miss Harlowe, Alisa Clarissa 
Harlowe's affair, said Lord M. 
with his usual fortvard bluntuesB. 
That, sir, is what you mean. She 
is, by all accounts, the most excel- 
lent woman in the world. 

I am glad to hear that is your 
lordship's opinion of her. It is 

It is not only my opinion, Co!. 
Morden (proceeded the prating 
peer)but it is the opinion of allmy 
family: of my sisters, of my 
and of nlr. Lovelace him- 



Ihave done myself in 



self. 

Cot. Would to heaven it had al- 
ways been Mr. Lovelace's opinion 
of her! 

Lovei. You have bet 
England, colonel, a good many 
years. Perhaps you are not yet 
fully apjirized of all the pnrtii 
Jars of this case. 



Col. 1 have been out of Eng> 
landj sir, about seven years. My 
cousm Clary was then abont Iwelcfi 
years of age: but never waa theref 
at Iwetiiy so discreet, so prudent 
aud BO excellent a creature. Alt' 
that knew her, or saw her, ad- 
mired her. Mind and person/ 
never did I see snoh promiaes o 

ferfection in any young lady: anf 
am told, nor w it to be wondered 
at, that as she advanced to mato-' 
rity, she more than justified and 
made good those promises. - 
Then as to fortune — what he 
father, what her uncles, andiriii 
I myself, intended to do forberi 
besides what her grandfather hao 
done — there is uot a finer fb ' " 
in the county. 

Lopel. All this, colonel, uid 
more than this, is Miss ClarissA 
Harlowe ; and had it not been for 
the implacableness and viole ' 
of her family (all resolved to pu_^ 
her upon a match as unwortSy w/ 
her, as hateful tu her) ebe had stiff 
been happy. 

Col. I own, Mr. Lovelace, tlu 
truth of what you observed juit 
now, that 1 am uot thoroughly ac- 
quainted with all that has passed 
Between you and my cousin. But 
pei-mit me to say, that when 1 GnC 
heard, that you made your ad- 
dresses to her, I knew hut of onr 
objection against you. That, 
deed,avery great one; and upon 
a letter sent me, I gave her mr 
free opinion upon tne subject' 
But had it not been for that, 1. 
own, that in my private mind 
there could not have been a mora 

• See Vol. U. p. MI, k leq.

CLARISSA HAItLOWB. 



BnHable match: for you are a gal- 
lant geutleman, graceful in your 
person, easy and genteel in your 
deportment, and iu yonr family, 
fortunes, aud expectations, happy 
as a man can wish to be. Then 
the knowledge I had of you in 
Italy (although, give me leave to 
say, your conduct there was not 
wholly uneiueptionahle) con- 
vinces me that you are brave: and 
few gentlemen come up to you in 
wit and vivacity. Your education 
haH given you great advantages; 
your maiiuers are engaeitiR, and 
you have travelled; and I know, 
if you'll excuse me, you make 
better observations than you are 
governed by. All these qualifica. 
tions make it not at all surprising, 
that a young lady should love 
you: and that this love, joined to 
that indiacreet warmth wherewith 
my cousin's friends would have 
forced her inclinations in favour 



ofm 






shonld throw her upon your pro- 
tection. But then, if there were 
these two strong motives, the one 
to induce, the other to impel her, 
let me ask you, sir, ifshe were not 
doubly entitled to generous usage 
from a man whom she chose for 
her protector; and whom, let me 
take the liberty to say, she could 
so amply reward for the protec- 
tion he was to afford her? 

Lnuel. Miss Clarissa Harlowe 
was entitled, sir, to the beat usage 
that man could give her. I have 
no scruple to own it I will al- 
ways do her the justice that she 
so well deserres. X know what 



19b 

will be your inference; and have 
ouly to say, that time. past can- 
uot be recalled. Perhaps I wish 
it could. 

The colonel, then in a very 
manly strain, set forth the wickea- 
ness of attempting a woman of 
virtue and character. He said 
that men had generally too many 
advantages from the weakness, 
credntity, and inexperience of the 
fair sex : that their early learning, 
which chiefly consisted in in- 
flarniag novels, and idle and im- 
probable romances, contributed 
to enervate and weaken their 
minds : that his cousin, however, 
he was sm-e, was above the reach 
of common seduction, and not to 
be influenced to the rashness her 
parents accused her of, by weaker 
motives than Iheir violence, and 
the most solemn promises on my 
part: but, nevertheless, kavinr; 
those motives and her pmdenoe 
(eminent as it was) being rather 
the eSectoicimsiiUiiiontiiaatxpO' 
rieitce, (a fine advantage, however, 
he said, to ground anunblameable 
ftiture life upon] she might not be 
apprehensive of bad designs in a 
man she loved: it was therefore, a 
very heinous thing to abuse the

manner; when, interrupting him, 
I said: These general observa- 
tions, colonel, suit not perhaps 
this particular case. But you

He proceeded. As yon seem to 
call upon me, Mr. Lovelace, I will 
tell you (withont boasting of it) 
what has been my general prac- 
tice, till lately, that 1 hope I have 
reformed it a good deal. 

Ihave taken iiburtiea, wbioh the 
lawa of morality will by no meana 
justify; and once I should have 
tkooKht myself warranted to cut 
the uiroat of aiiy young fellow, 
who should make as free with a 
sister of mine, »s 1 have made

others. liut then I took c 
never to promise any thing I 
tended not to perform. A moc 
ear should as soon have hoard 
downright obacenity from my 
lips, as matrimony, it I had not '- 
tended it. Young ladies are ^ 
nerally ready enough to believe 
we mean honourably, if they love 
ua; and it would look like a 
strange afiVont to their virtue and 
charms , that it should be sup- 
posed needfal to put the (juestion

Lovel. (cooilij) Come, come, 
Col. Morden, don't let thia dis- 
pute, whatever you intend to 
make of it, go further than nitfa 
you and me. You deliver your- 
self in very high terma. Higher 
than ever I was talked to in my 
life. But here, beneatli this roof, 
it would be inexcusable for me to 
take that notice of it, which per- 
haps it would become me to take 
elsewhere. 

C'lL This is spoken as I wish 
the man to speak , whom I should 
be pleased to call my friend, if ail 
his actions were of a piece; and 
as I would have the man speak, 
whom 1 would think it worth my 
while to call my foe. I love a 
mail of spirit, as I love my soul. 
But, Mr. Lovelace , as my lord 
thinks we aim at otiemarh^ let me 
say , that were we permitted to be 
aloue for sii minutes , I dare aay, 
we should eoon understand oue 
another perfectly well. — And he 
moved to the door.

Colonel Morden to be, (rash as

comes to my Lord M.'s bonse, in

Mowbray, leave us. You have 
really no concern in this bueinesa; 
and if you are my friend, I desire 
you'll ask the colonel pardon for 
interfering in it in the manner yon

ability to defend his own c&oM, 
were it a cause to be defended. 
And let me tell you, Ur. Lore*

let me desire you to lay youT 
beads together nmicHbly, and 
think whether there be any thing 
to be done to make all endhappily 
for the lady, 

LiivpI. But hold, my lord, let 
me say one thing now Mowbray k 
gone; and that is, that I think a 
gentleman ought not to put up 
tamely one or two severe things 
that the colonel has said. 

L-rd M. Wtat the devil canst 
thou mean? I thought all 
been over. Why thon haat 
thing to do , but to confirm to 
colonel, that thou art willing to 
manj Miss Ilarlowe, if she will 
have thee. 

Col. Mr. Lovelace will not 
BCrupIe to say Ibal, I suppose, not- 
withalandmg all thut has passed: 
but if you think, Mr. Lovelace, 
1 have said any thing I should not 
have aaid. I suppose it is tf 
that the man who has shewn 
little of the tliiiii/ honour, to 
defenceless unprotected womt 
ought not to stand so nicely upon 
the empit) name of it, with a man 
who is expostulating with him 
Upon it. I am sorry to have cause 
to Bay this, Mr. Lovelace; but I 
would on the same occasion, re-

and surrounded Dy all his guards.

bring about a reconciliation with

it ia not a little owing to ber fa-

herTileiy; but is willing to repair 
her wrongs — 

Lord. Not, my lord, for tlie 
sake of her family; nor for this 
gentleman's haughty behaviour; 
but for her oicn saire, and in full 
sense of the wrongs 1 have done 

Col, As to roy hauglity be-

gone beyond itiu the like case, of 
a relation so meritorious, and so 
unworthily injured. And, sir, let

are not love, honour, and justice, 
and if they have the least tmcture 
of meancompaasion forfcr, or of 
an uncheerfiil asseat on yow par/, 
I am sure it will neither be desired

that 1 am meanly compounding

given me for it; but thus much^ 
will tell you, that my lord, th&U

this he wanted to declare, and 
would soiHier have declared, if he 
could have brought us sooner to 
patience , and a good under- 
standing. 

The colonel made excuses for 
his warmth, on the score of his 
affectionto his cousin. 

My regard for her made me 
readily admit them; andsoafresh 
bottle of Burgundy, and another

which gome feared would have beer

I told the colonel, "whateamest

upon the lady not to slip a day 
that had been proposed for the 
private celebration of our nuptiala ; 
and of my letters* written to her- 
self on that subject;" for I had 
stepped to my closet, and fetched 
down all the letters and draughts, 
and copies of letters, relating to 
this affaur. 

I read to him "several passages 
in the copies of those letters, which

him, "that 1 wished I bad kept

how much in earnest I 
professions to her, al- 
thoueh sfie would not answer oi 
of them." And thou njay'st n 
member, that ono of those fboT 
letters accounted to herself, wb/ 
1 was desirous she should remain, 
where I had left her.* 

I then proceeded to give him ta,' 
account "of the visit made hf, 
Lady Sarah and Lady Betty to 
LordM.andme.in order to indncs 
me to do her justice: ofmytead)^

(though so much to my diiad-

This made him ready tothinlw

And this also the colonel hiehly 
applauded, and was pleased to 
lament the unhappy misunder- 
standing between the two families, 
which had made the Uarlowes leas 
fond of an alliance with a family 
of 80 much honour, as this iustance 
shewed ours to be. 

I then told him, "that having, 
by my friend, [meaning thee] who 
was admitted into her presence, 
(and who had always been an 
admirer of her virtues, and had 
pvennte such advice from time to 
Ume in relation to her as 1 wished 
I had followed) been assured, that 
a visit from me would be very dis- 
agreeable to her, I once more 
resolved to try what a letterwould 
do; and that, accordingly, on the 
7th of August 1 wrote to her one. 

"This, colonel, is the copy of it. 
I was then out of humour with my 
lOrdlfT. and the ladies of myfa- 
Tou will therefore read it 
bjonradf."*

This letter gave him high aatis- 
faction. You write here , Mr, 
Lovelace, from your heart. 'Tisa 
letter full of penitence and ac- 
knowledsment. Your request is 
reasonable — to be forgiven only 
as you shall appear to deserve it 
after a time of probation, which 
you leave to her to fix. Pray, sir, 
did she return an answer to this 
letter? 

She did, but with I'e/MCfaitce, I 
own, and not tilll had declared by 
my friend, that if 1 could not pro- 
cure one, I would go up to town, 
and throw myself at her feet. 

1 wish 1 might be permitted to 
see it, sir, or to hear such parts 
of it read, as you ahall think 
proper. 

Turoiug over my papers, Here 
it is, sir.* I will make no scruple 
to put it into your hands. 

This is very obliging, Mr.Love- 

Hereadit. Mycharmingcousin! 
— How strong her resentment! — 
Yet, how charitable herwishesl 
Good heaven! that such an ei- 
cellent creature — but, Mr. Love- 
lace , it is to your regret, as much 
as to mine, 1 doubt not — 

Interrupting him, I swore that 
it was. 

Soitought, said be. Nordol 
wonder that it should be so. I 
shall tell you by-und-by, pro- 
ceeded he, how much she suffers 
with her friends by false and 
villainous reports. But, sir. will 
yon permit me to take with me 
these two letters? I shall make

use of them to the advantage of 
you both. 

I told him, I would oblige him 
with all my heart And this he 
took very kindly (as he had rea- 
son) ; and put them in his pocket- 
book, promising to return them in 
a few days. 

I then told him, " that upon this 
her refusal, I took upon myself to 
go to town, in hopes to move her 
m my favour; and that, though I 
went without giving her notice of 
my intention, yet had she got some 
notion of my coming , and so con- 
trived to be out of the way : and 
at last, when she found I was fully 
determined at all events to see her, 
before I went abroad, (which I 
shall do, said I, if I cannot prevail 
upon her) she sent me the letter I 
have already mentioned to you, 
desiring me to suspend my pur> 
posed visit: and that for a reason 
which amazes and confounds me \ 
because I don*t find there is any 
thing in it: and yet I never knew 
her once dispense with her word ; 
for she always made it a maxim, 
that it was not lawful to do «i7, that 
good might come of it: and yet in 
this letter, for no reason in the 
world but to avoid seeing me, (to 
gratify an humour only) has she 
sent me out of town, depending 
upon the assurance she had given 
me. 

Col, This is indeed surprising. 
But I cannot believe that my 
cousin, for such an end only, or in> 
deed for any end, according to the 
character 1 hear of her, should 
stoop to make use of such an 
artince. 



Lovel, This, colonel, is the tiung 
that astonishes me; and yet, see 
here! — This is the letter she 
wrote me — nay , sir , 'tis her own 
hand. 

Col. I see it is; and a charming 
hand it is. 

LoveL You observe, colonel, 
that all her hopes of reconciliation 
with her parents are from yon. 
You are her dear blessed friend! 
She always talked of you with 
delight. 

Col. Would to heaven I had 
come to England before she left 
Harlowe Place ! — Nothing of this 
had then happened. Not a man 
of those whom I have heard that 
her friends proposed for her, 
should have had her. Nor yon, 
Mr. Lovelace , unless I had found 
you to be the man, every one who 
sees you must wish you to be: and if 
you had been that man, no one 
living should I have preferred to 
you for such an excellence. 

Mj lord and I both joined in the 
wish: and 'faith I wished it most 
cordially. 

The colonel read the letter twice 
over , and then returned it to me. 
'Tis all a mystery, said he. I can 
make nothing of it. For, alas ! her 
friends are as averse to a recon- 
ciliation as ever. 

Lord M. I could not have 
thought it. But don't you think 
there is something very favour- 
able to my nephew in this letter 
— something tnat looks as if the 
lady would comply at last? 

Col. Let me die if I know what 
to make of it. This letter is very 
different from her preceding one. 



ri- You returned an answer to it, 
Mr. Lovelace? 
Lnvel. An answer, colonel! No 
doubt of it. And an answer full 
of transport. 1 told her, "I would 
directly set out for LordM.'s, in 
obedience to Uer will. I told her 
that I would consent to an; tiling 
she should command , in order to 

r'omote this hapjiy reconciliation, 
told her, thiLt it should be my 
hourly study to the end of my life, 
to deserve a goodness so transcen- 
dent" But I cannot forbear Bay- 
ing, that I am not a little shocked 
andenrpriied, if nothingmorebe 
meant by it , than to get me into 

^tIle country without seeing her. 
Col. That can't be the thing, 
'«|epeaduponit,sir: there must be 
iboie in it thsii that. For were 
Aat all, she must think you would 
soon be undeceived , and that you 
woald then most probably resume 
your intention ~ unless , indeed, 
she depended upon seeing tiie in 
the interim, as she knew 1 wtis 
arrived. But I own, I know not 
what to make of it. Only that

But I shall know better how to^

James comes from Edinburgh; 
and he is every hour espected. 

But let me ask you, Mr. Love- 
lace, what is the name of your 
friend , who is admitted so easily 
into my cousin's presence? Is it 
not Belford, pray? 

Lovel. It is, air; Mr.Belford is 
amau of honour; andagreatad- 
mirer of your fair cousin. 

Was 1 right, as to the ;?<■,!/, Jack ? 
The laul 1 have such strong proof 
of, that it makes me questjon the 
^rst; since she would not have 
been out of the way of my intend- 
ed visit but for thee. 

Cot. Are you sure, air, that Mr. 
Belford is a man of honour? 

Liipcl. I can swear for him, 
colonel. What makes you put 
this question? 

Col. Only this; that anofficiouf 
pragmatical novice has been sent 
up to inquire into my cousin's life 
and conversation; and, would you 
believeitjthei'reQueutvisiUof this 
:entleman have oeen interpreted 



and you will be shocked at every 
part of it. 

This cursed letter, no doubt, is 
from the young Levite, whom 
thou. Jack, descrihedat, as making 
inquiry of Mrs. Smith about Miss 
Harlowe's character and visitors.* 

I believe I was a quarter of an 
hour in reading it: fori made it, 
though not a short one, six times' 
as long as it is, by the additions of 
oaths and curses to every pedantic 
line. Lord M. too helped to 
lengthen it, by the like ezecra- 



* aeev.S&i^Vwit 



tions. And thou, Jack, wilL have 
asmucLreason tocurseit as we. 

You cannnt but see, said the 
colonel, yiben 1 had done reading 
it, that thiBfellowhaabeen ii/yfci'ouj' 
in his malevolence; for what he 
saya ie mere hearaay, and that 
hearaay conjectural scandal, 
without fact, or the appearance 
of fact, to support it; bo tbatan 
nnprejudiced eye, upon the face 
of the letter, would condemn the 
writer of it , as I did , and acquit 
my cousin. But yet, such ia the 
Bpiritby which the rest of my rela- 
tions are governed , that they run 
away with the belief of the worst 
itinsinnates, and the dear creature 
has had shocking letters upon it; 
the pedant's hints are taken . and 
a voyage to one of the colonies 
has been proposed to her, as the 
only way to avoid Mr. Belford and 
you. I have not seen these letters, 
indeed; but they took a pride in 
repeating aome of their contents, 
which must have cut the poor aoul 
to the heart; and these, joined to 
her former sufferinga — what have 
you not, Mr. Lovelace, to answer 
for? 

Jju'el. Wbolhedevilconldhave 



there could be parents so impla- 
cable? Brother and sister so

body? — And what now can be

lus cousin. And by her last letter, 
it runs in my mind , that she bai 
some thoughts of forgiving all 
that's past. Do you thinK, colonel, 
if there should not be such a thing 
as a reconciliation going faiwara 
at present, that her letter may oot- 
imnl^, that if we t^'iu/fJ bring sQcli 
a Uiing to bear with her friends, 
she would be reconciled withMr. 
Lovelace? 

C'll. Such an artifice would 
better become the Italian aub- 
tility, than the English sii 
Your lordship has been it 
presume? 

Loeel. My lord has read Boc- 
.caccio, perhaps; and that's as 
well, aa to the hint he gives, which 
may be borrowed from one of that 
author's stories. But MisaCIfliTisrt 
Harlowe is above all artifice. Shs 
must have some meaning I a 
fathom. 

Col. Well, my lord, I can only 
say, that I will make soineuseof 
the letters Mr. LoreJace baa ob- 
liged me with: and after 1 b 
had some talk with my oouria 
James, who is hourly expected) 
and when 1 have dispatched two 
or three affairs that press upon 
me; 1 will pay myrespecta toBiy 
dear cousin; and shall then H 
able to form a bet 
things. Me3ntim< 
her; for 1 have a 
about her, and find she wanU 
consolation. 

Ltivel- If you favour me, co- 
lonel, with the d— n'd letter of 
that fellow Brand, for a day o 
two, you will oblige me. 

Col. Iwill, but remember, itj 



^najt isaparson, Mr.Lovelace; an 
iBaocent one too they eaj. Else 
1 had been at him before now. 
AAd these college novices^ who 
think thej know everj thing in 
their cloisters , and that all learn- 
ing lies in bouts, make dismal 
figureB when they come into the 
world among inen and icnrnen. 

Lord M. Brand! Bniiid! It 
should have been Firebraml , I 
tbiiikf inmy conscience! 

Thua ended thia doughty con- 
ference. 

1 cannot say, Jack, hut I am 
greatly taken with Col. Morden. 
He is bravo and gecerona, and 
knowB the world; and then biB 
contempt of the jiaraonn ia a 
t&in Eign that he is one of us. 

We parted with great civi 
Liord U. (not a little pleased that 
wo did, and as greatly taken with 
the colonel) repeated his wish, 
after the colonel was gone, that 
he had arrived in time to save the 
lady; if that would have done it. 

I wish so too. For, by my aonl, 
Jack, I am every day more and 
more uneaay about her. Butlhope 
she is not BO ill as I am told she is. 

IhavemadeCharlotte transcribe 
the letter of thia Firehranil, as my 
lord calls him; and will inclose 
her copy of it. All thy phlegm 1 
know will be roused into venge- 
ance when thou rcadest it, 

I know not what to adi'ise as 
to Bhewing it to the lady. Yet, 
perhaps, she will be ablt

innocence; in that it will give

glad to tind out the shadow of a

colonel says they have sent her, 
and for their proposal to her of 
;oing to some one of the colonies. 
Confound them all — but if I

Dr. Lewen once, in your pre-

siurtrliii kind of debate be-

him to censure thejiarmlhetical 
style, as I call it. He was a very 
learned and judicious man, to 
be sure, and an ornament to niir 
functitin: but yet I must needs 
say, that it is a style which 1 
greatly lilte ; and the good doc- 
tor was then past his yiuth, and 
that time of life, of consequence, 
when a fertile {maifmatiim, and 
i-ich faniy, pour in ideas ao fast 
Qpon a writer, that parentheses 
are often wanted (and that for 
the salie of hrecity, as well as 
perspicuity) to save the reader 
the trouble of reading apassage

although 1 had been come irom 
thence but about imhour, andhad 
taken leave of the lady for the 
night. 

I sent down for Mrs. Lovicfc, and 
desired her, in the firatplace, to 
acquaint the lady (who was busied 
in ber closet) that I had letters 
from Berks; in which 1 was in- 
formed that the interview between 
Col. Morden and Mr. Lovelace had 
ended without ill consequences^ 
that the colonel intended to write 
to her very soon, and was bterest- 
ing himself meanwhile in her fa- 
vour, with her relations: that I 
hoped, that this agreeable news 
would be the means of giving her 
good rest; and I would wait upon 
her in the morning, by the time 
she should return from prayers, 
with all the particulars. 

She sent me word, that ahe 
sliould be glad to aee me in the 
morning; and was highly obliged 
to me for the good newslhad sent 

Ithen, in the back-shop, read 
to Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith,

distinguish the iroth and nrhipt- 
Byllabub in them , from the cream, 
in what one could and rrmld nni 
readtoa womanof eofineamind; 
since four pnrts out of six of thj 
letters, which I thought enter- 
taining sa 1 read them to myself, 
appeared to me, when I would 
have read them to her, most ab- 
ominable atuif, and gave mea very 
contemptible idea of thy talents, 
and of my own judgment. 

She was far from rejoicing, ae 
I had done, at the disappointment 
her letter gave you when 
plained. 

She said, nhe meant only ai 
nocent allegory, which might 
carry instruction and warning to 
you, when the meaning was taken, 
a,e well as answer her own bopcf 
for the time. It was run off in « 
hurry. She was afraid it was not 
quite right in her. But hoped the 
end would excuse [if it could not 
justify) the means. And then she 
again expressed a good deal of 
apprehension, lest you should still 
t^e it into your head to molest 
her, when her time, she said, was 
BO short, that she wanted every 
moment of it; repeating what she 
bad said once before, that when 
she wrote, she was so ill, that she 
believed she should not have lived 
till now. If she had thought she 
should, she must have studied for 
an expedient that would have 
better answered her intentions. 
Hinting at a removal out of the 
knowledge of ua both. 

But she was much pleased that

Imd, aman of his character might 
have thought himself warranted 
to endeavour to take ungeneroue

had been able to inspire. The 
consciousness ofmgoipii weakness

that is, because 1 think his crimes

piece with thy generosity to thy 
Rosebud and her Johnny ; and to 
a number of other good actions, 
in pecuniary matters: although 
thy Rosebud's is, I believe, the 
only instance, where a pretty' 
woman was concerned, of such a 
disinterested bounty. 

Upon my faith, Lovelace, I love 
topraisethee; and often and often, 
as thou knowest, have I studied for 
occasions to do it : insomuch, that 
when for the life of me I could not 
think of any thing done by thee 
that deserved praise, I have taken 
pains to applaud the not ungrace- 
ful manner in which thou hast 
performed actions that merited 
the gallows. 

Now thou art so near, I will 
dispatch my servant to thee if 
occasion recjuires. But, I fear, I 
shall soon give thee the news thou 
apprehendest. For I am just now 
sent for by Mrs. Smith; who has 
ordered the messenger to tell me, 
that she knew not if the lady will 
be alive when I come. 

Friday, Sept. 1. Two o'clock at Smith's. 

I COULD not close my letter in 
such an uncertainty as must have 
added to your impatience. For 
you have, on several occasions, 
convinced me , that the suspense 
you love to give, would be the 
greatest torment to you that you 
could receive. A common case with 
all aggressive and violent spirits, 
I believe. I will just mention then 
(your servant waiting here till I 
nave written) that the lady has 
had two very severe fits: in the 
last of which whilst she lay, they 



sent to the doctor and Mr. God- 
dard , who both advised that a 
messenger should be dispatched 
for me, as her executor; bebg 
doubtful whether, if she had a 
third, it would not carry her off. 

She was tolerably recovered by 
the time I came; and the doctor 
made her promise before me, that, 
while she was so weak, she would 
not attempt any more to go 
abroad; for, by Mrs. Lovick's 
description who attended her, the 
shortness of her breath, her ex- 
treme weakness , and the fervour 
of her devotions when at church, 
were contraries, which, pulling 
different ways, (the soul aspiring, 
the body sinking) tore her tender 
frame in pieces. 

So much for the present. I shall 
detain Will no longer than just to 
beg , that you will send me back 
this packet, and the last. Your 
memory is so good, that once 
reading is all you ever give, or 
need to give, to any thing. And 
who but ourselves can make oirf 
our characters, were you inclined 
to let any body see what passes 
between us? Ifl cannot be obliged, 
I shall be tempted to with-nold 
what I write till 1 have time to take 
a copy of it. * 

A letter from Miss Howe is just

a partnership in any thing with 
such a family. 

But this I mention as an answer 
to thy reproaches that I could be 
so little edified by the perfections, 
to which thou supposest, I was for 
so long together daily and hourly 
a personal witoess — when admir- 
able as she was in all she said, and 
in all she did, occasion had not at 
that time ripened, and called forth 
those amazmg perfections which 
now astonish ana confound me. 

Hence it is , that I admire her 
more than ever; and that my love 
for her is less personal^ as I may 
gay, more intellectual, than ever I 
thought it could be to woman. 



Hence als^ :t is, thak I am eon- 
fident would it please the Fates 
to spare her, and make her mine) 
I could love her with a purity thtt 
would draw on auf omm Fcnras, ts 
well as ensure Ker TaaomAL hap- 
piness. — And henee, bjneeessaiy 
consequence, shall 1 be the most 
miserable of all men, if 1 am de- 
prived of her. 

Thou severely reflectest iqMm 
me for my levity; the Abbey in- 
stance in thine eye, I suppose. 
And I will be ingenuous enongh 
to own, that as thou seestnotmy 
heart , there may be passages, in 
every one of my letters, which (the 
; melancholy occasion considered) 
I deserve thy most pointed rebukes. 
i But, faith. Jack, thou art such a 
tragi -comical mortal, with thy 
leaden aspirations at one time, 
and thy flying hour-glasses and 
i dreaming terrors at another, that, 
as Prior says. What serious iSj thu 
turri'st to farce; and it is impos- 
sible to keep within the bounds 
of decorum or gravity, when one 
reads what thou writest. 

But to restrain myself, (for mj 
constitutional gaiety was ready to 
run away with me again) I will 
repeat, I must ever repeat, that 
I am most egregiously affected 
with the circumstances of the 
case: and, were this paragon 
actually to quit the world!, should 
never enjoy myself one hour to- 
gether, though I were to live to 
the age of Methusalem. 

Indeed it is to this deep concern, 
that my lemty is owing: for 1 
struggle and struggle, and tij to 
buffet down my cruel reflections

a itii'ced, oslhave often Bald,! 
to try to make myself laugh, that' 
I may not cry: for one or other I 
must do: audiaituot philoKO^h}' 
carried to the higheaC pitch, for v, 
maji to conquer such tumults of 
Boul as I am sometimes agitated 
by, and, in thevery height of the 
Blorm, to be able to quaver out an 
horse-laugh? 

You rSenecafl,yourEpicletuBes. 
and the reat of your stoical tribe, 
with all their apathy-nonaense, 
could not come up to this. They 
could fbrbear wry faces; bodily 
pains they could well enough seeai 
to support; and that was all: hut 
the pangs of their own sinitten' 
down souls they could not lauff) 
over, though they could at Iht 
follies of others. They read grave 
lectures; but they icere grave. 
This high point of philoaophy, to 
laugh and be merry in the midst 
of the most aoul- harrowing 
when the heart-strings " " 
tnting asunder, was res 
rliorelace. 

There is something owing to 
Itotitution, lown; and that thif

For what a woe must that be, 
which for au hour together can

not lucid intervals, if tbev did not 
come and go, there would be no 
bearing them. 

Aftsu all, as I am so little

The lady ia alive, and serene, 
and calm, and baa all her noble 
intellects clear and strong: but 
nineteen will not however save her. 
She says, she will ni^w content her- 
self with her closet duties, and the 
visits of the parish minister; 
will not attempt to go out. Nor, 
indeed, will she, I am afraid, ever 
walk up or down a pair of Etairs 



I a 



JOrry at my soul to have 
ly : but it would be a folly 



this to say 
to flatter thee. 

Aa to thy seeing her, I believe 
the least hint of that sort, now, 
would cut off some houra of her 
life. 

What baa contributed 
serenity, it seems, ia that taking 
the alarm her fits gave her, she 
has entirely finisbed, and signed 
and sealed, her last will: which 
she had deferred doing till tbis; 
time, in hopes, as she said, of some i 



good news from Harlowe Place, 
nhich would have induced her [o 
alter some passages in it. 

KIJEsHowe's letter wasnot given 
her till foor in the aftemoon, 
yesterday; at which time the 
messenger returned fbrananswer. 
She admitted faim into her pre- 
sence in the dining- room, ill asshe 
then was, and she would have 
written a few lines, aadeairedby 
Miss Howe; but not being able to 
hold a pen, ahe bid themeBaenget 
tell her, that she hoped to be w«ll 
enough to write a long letter bj 
ueit day's post; and wonla 
□o<v detain him. 



CALLED just now, and foiml, 
the lady writing to Miss Hoha 
She made me a melancholy con- 
>liment, that she shewed me not 
liss Howe's letter, because I 
hould soon have that and all bet 
papers before me. But she toU 
me, that Miss Ho we bad very oo*' 
siderately obviated to Coloid 
Morden several things which 
might have occasioned misappl*- 
benstons between him and m»\ 
and had likewise put aligbter con- 
struction, for the aake ofpeace,ei 
some of your actions, taaa tb«r 
deserved. 

She added, that her counn 
Morden was warmly engaged in 
her favour with her friends; and 
one good piece of neirs Hio 
Howes letter contained; that bet

froj^era, I shall again be happy. 
write with still the more alacrity, 
aa I have an opportunity pivenme 
to tODch upon a subject in which 
yoa are nearly concerned. 

You must know then, my dear, 
that your cousin Morden has been 
here with me. He told me of an 
interview he had on Monday at < 
Lord M.'s with Lovelace; and 
asked me abundance of qnestiooB 
about you , and about that 
viilainoua man. 

I could have raised a fine flame 
between them if I would: but, 
observing that he is a man of very 
livelv passiona, and believing you 
would be miserable if any thiug 
should happen to him from a 
quarrel with a man who is known 
to have so many advantages athis 
aword, I made not the worst of the 
subjects we talked of. Bi 
could not tell untruths 
favour, you must think I said 
enough to make him curse the 
wretcli. 

I don't find, well as they used to 
respect Colonel Morden, that he 
has influence enough upon them 
to bring them to any terms of re- 
conciliation. 

What can they mean by it? — 
But your brother ia come home, it 
seems; so, the honour of the house, 
the reputation of the family, is all 
the cry 1 

The colonel ia exceedingly out 
of humour with them all. Yet has 
he not hitherto, it seems, i 
jfoar bmtal hrolhei. I told 



how ill yon were, i 
cated to him eome of the content! 
of your letter. He admired yau, 
cursed Xdcefarc. and raved against 

all your family, — He declared, 
that they were all unworthy <» 
yon. 

At his earnest request, 1 per- 
mitted him to take some brirf 
notes of such of the contents ofi 
your letter to rae, as I thought I 
cimlil read to him; and, particu- 
larly, of your melancholy 
elusion.* 

Me says, that none of yoni 
friends think yon so ill as yoa AM| 
nor will believe it. He is mii 
they all love you, and that dea^

The colonel (as one of your

actually engaged them to reinit ti

"" )plieB; since they were deter- 
led to diatreaayou, and to put

|hy say that without offence. 

lour cousin imagines, that, 

^Tre a reconciliation takes pi ace, 
r will ineiat, that you shall 
:esiich a will, as to that estate, 
a they ahall approve of; but he 
declares, he will not go out of 
England till he has seen justice 
done you by eaery l/ody; and that 



yon shall not be imposed on either 
by friend or foe — 

IJy relation or foe, should he not 
have said ? — For a friend will not 
impoae upon a friend. 

So, my dear, you are trf Any ji'cr 
peace, if some people are to have 
their wills! 

Your cousin [not /, my dear, 
though it was always myopinion"] 
aays, that the whole family ia Ion 
rir/i, to he either himhU, ron- 
«iilerale, or cin/nitaf. And as for 
himaelf , he has an ample fortune, 
he snys, and thinks of leaving it 
wholly to j-ou. 

Had this Tiliain Lovelace con- 
sulted his worldly interest atily, 
what a fortune would he have had 
in yon, even although your marry- 
ing him had lieprived you of a 
paternal share ! 

I am obliged to leave off here. 
But having a good deal still to 
write, ana my mother better, I 
will pursue the subject in another 
letter, although I send both to- 

f ether. 1 need not say how much 
am, and will ever be, 

Your affectionate, &c.

that there wae no need of any

letters you had written to your 
friends, and which bad been shewn

worse than perjury, broach of 
faith, and abuse of a generous 
confidence, were to appearl — 

Iaorry fellowsl] he would avenge 
lis cousin to the utmost. 

I urged your apprehensiona on 
thia head from your last letter to 
me: but he seemed capable of 
taking what I kuow to be real 
greatness of Goul, in an unworthy 
sense: for he meutioned directly 
upon it, the eipectatiou your 
friends had, that you should (pre- 
vious to any reconciliation with 
them) appear in a court of justice 
against the villain — If you could 
do it with the advantage to your- 
self that I hiuted might be done. 

And truly.ifl would havebeard 
him, he had indelicacy euougli to 



have gone into the nature of the 
proof of the crime upon which thsj 
wanted to have Lovelace a^ 
raigned. Yet thia is a man im- 

B roved by travel and learning! —

have been accustomed t« the moM 
delicate conversation ever nncefl 
had the honour to know yon, (JM 
apiae this sei from the gentlemllF 
down to the peasant. 

Upon the whole , I find that Ht, 
Morden has avery slender notim 
of women's virtue, iu particalO' 
cases: for which reason I pot bin 
down, though yourfavourite, at 
one who is not entitled tn cant (1*

I never knew a man who de- 
served to be well thougbt of hin-

the difference of leniperamait Iiii

LETTER xcvi. 



I vroKCEs not at the impatience 
your servant tells me you express 
to bcur from me. I was designiuf 
to write you a loDg tetter, am 
was just returned from Smith' 
for tbat purpose; bat since yoi 
are BO urgent, you must be con 
tented with a short one. 

J attended the lady thie morn 
iug, just before I set out for 
Kdgeware. She was bo ill over 
night, that she was obliged t( 
leave unfinished her letter to Mis 
Howe, But early this mominf 
she made an end of it, and bai 
just sealed it up as I came. Shi 
was so fatigued with writing, tbat 
she told me she would lie down 
after I waa gone, and endeavour 
to recruit her apirits. 

They bad sent for Mr. Goddard, 
when she was so ill last night; 
and Hot being able to see nim 
out of her own chamber, he, for 
the first time, saw her house as 
she calls it. He was extremely 
shocked and concerned at it; and 
chid Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick 
for not persuading her to have 
such an object removed from ' 
bed-chombei': and when they 



cused themselves on the lillU 
itharity it was reasonable to suu- 
poae they must have with a lady 
so much their superior, here- 
fleeted warmly ou those whohad 
re authority, and who lefther 
proceed with such a shock- 
; and solemn whimsy , as be 
lied it. 

It is placed near the windo*. 
like a harpsichord, thoiieh covered 
to the ground: and wbenshe 
ill , tbat she cannot well go 
to her closet, she writes and reads 
upon it, SB othera would uponi 
desk or table. But (only aa ahe 
ill last night) she cfaooau 
tee any body in that apart 

I went to Edgewttre; aud, re- 
turning in the evening, attended 
her again. She bad a letter 
brought her from Mrs. Norton (a 
long one, as itseemsby ilsbnlk'i 
just before I came. But sbehni) 
not opened it; and said, thatw 
she was pretty calm and com- 
posed, ahewas afraid to loolcinli) 
the contents, lest she should be 
ruflled; expecting, now, to liev 
of nothbg that could do her good 
or give her pleasure firom thtl 
good woman's dear hard-hear^ti 
neighbours., as she called het own

rememher the linea of Howard, 
which once you read to me in my 
ivy bower?* 

Id the diapoaition of what be- 
loDgB to me, I have CDdeavoured 
to do every thing in the justest 
and beat manner Icould think of: 
putting myself in my relations 
places, and in the greater points, 
ordering my matters, as if no mis- 
understanding had happened. 

I hope they mil not think much 
of some bequests where wanted, 
and where due from my gratitude: 
but if they should, what is done, 
iadone; and I cannot now help it. 
Yet I must repeat, that I hope, I 
hope, 1 have pleased every oue of 
them. For I would not, on any 
account, have it thought, that, 
in my last disposition , anything 




. should have had place 
in a mind that is so truly A'ee (as I 
will presume to say) from all re- 
sentment, that it now overflows 
with gratitude and blessings for 
the good I have received, althongh 
it be not all that ray heart wished

thatlwas not favoured with more, 
what is it but an hardship of half 
a year, against the mnsi indulgent 
goodness of eighteen years and 
an half, that ever was shewn to a 
daughter? 
My cousin, you tell me, thinks 
was off my guard, and that I was 
taken at some disadvantage. In- 
deed, my dear, I was not. Indeed 
I gave no room for advantage to 
he taken of me. 1 hope, one day, 
that will be seen, it I have the 
justice done me which Mr. Belford 

I should hope, that my cousin 
hasnottaken the liberties, which 
you, (by an observation nut, in. 
geueral, unjnet) seem to charge 
him with. For it is sad to think, 
that the generality of that sex 
should make so light of crimes, 
which they justly hold so unpar- 
donable in their own most in- 
timate relations of ours — yet 
cannot conimitthem without doing 
such injuries to other families aa 
they thiuk themselves obliged to 
resent unto death, when offered

jaar penitence; your ill health; 
your virtue, though once betrayed, 
and basely used ; he then read to 
them Mr. Lovelace's letter, a most 
contrite one indeed*; and your 
ir^ft-sDu/eii answer**; for that was 
what he justly called it; and he 
treated as it deserved Mr. Brand's 
officious information (of which, 1 
had before heard, he had made 
them ashamed) by representations 
fonnded upon inquiries made by 
Mr. Alston***, whom he had pro-

quaint himself with your manner

farewell of Miss Howe : Adieu , my 
dear, adi'm," are you words — 

0, my child! my childl said 
your mamma, weeping, and clasp- 
■-ig her hands. 

Dearmadam, said your brother, 
e so good as to think you have 
lore children than this ungrateful 

Yet your siater seemed af- 

Your uncle Harlowe, wiping 
bis eyes, O cousin, said he, if one 
thonghtthe poor girl was really so 



ill 

She mmt, said your uncle An- 
tony. This is written to her pri- 
vate friend. God forbid she should 
be quite lostl 

Your uncle Harlowe wished they 
did not carry their resentments 

I begged, for Kod's sake, wring- 
ing my hands, and with a bonded 
knee, that they would permit me 
to go up to you; eugagmg to give 
them a faithful account of the way 

{ou were in. But I was chidden 
y your brother; and this occa- 
sioned some angry words between 
him and Mr. Morden. 

I beheve , sir, I believe, madam, 
said your sister , to her father and 
mother, we need not trouble my 
cousin to read any more. It does 
but grieve and disturb you. My 
sister Clary seems to be ill: I think, 
if Mrs. Norton were permitted to 
go up to her, it would be right. 
Wickedly as she has acted, ifshe 
be truly penitent — 

Here she stopt; and every one 
being silent, 1 stood up once more, 
aud besought them to let lue govj

and then i offered to read a pas- 
sage or two in your letter to me of 
the 24th. Butlwastakeu up again 
by your brother; and this occa- 
sioned still hicber words bctneen 
the colonel and him. 

Your mother, hoping to gain 
upon your infleiible brother , and 
to divert the anger of the two 
gentlemen from each other, pro- 
poHcd that the colonel should pro- 
ceed in reading the minutes he 
had taken from yout letter. 

He accordingly read, "Of your 
resuming your pen; that you 
thought you bad taken your last 
farewell; and tlie reet of that very 
affecting passage, in which you 
are obliged to break off more than 
once and afterwards to take an 
airing in a chair." Your brother 
and sister were affected at this; 
and he had recourse to his saxiS- 
box. And where you comfort Miss 
Howe, and aay, "You shall be 
happy;" Itifi more, said he, than 
Bbe will let any body elae be. 

Your sister called you, aweet 
eoul! but with a low voice: then 



affected by your pathetic grief 
but that it was your talent. 

The colonel then went on to the 
good effect your airing had upon 
you; to your good wiBhea to Miaa 
Howe and Mr. Hickman; aud to 
your concluding sentence, that 
when the happy life you wished to 
her cornea to be wound up, she 
may be as calm aud as easy at 
quitting it, as you hope in G ' 
you shall be. Your mother co 
aot stand this; but lettred ti

comer of the room, and sobbed, 
and wept. Your father for a few 
minutes could not speak, though 
he seemed inclined to say aoine' 

Your uncles were also both af' 
fected ; — but your brother went 
round to each; and again reminded, 
yoiu' mother that she had olbw 
children: what was there, he said, 
ID what was read, but the result 
of the talent you had of movhij 
the passions? and he blamed them 
for choosing to hear read what 
they knew their abused induIgenoK

would induce one to suspect your 
virtue if you were to be encount-

I li^oubt not. If to be uncharitable

■our brother, in a passion . if I 
t Mr. Morden upon this busi- 
nesa. X would liave declined it: 
but you, sir, to his father, would 
not permit me so to do.

Ibatonght to be the object of every 
one's roaentmeut, who has either 
a value for the family, or for this 
luurratefnl girl? 

That's the man , said your cou- 
sin, whom last Monday, as you

the object of mine. But what could 
I aS7i when I found bim so willing

to repair his crime? — And I give 
itasmy opinion, and have written 
accorduigly tomypoorcousin,that 
it is best for all round, that his 
oSer should be accepted^ and let 
me tell you — 

Tell me nothing, said your fa- 
ther, quite enraged, of tbatvery 
vile fellow I I have a riveted 
hatred to him. I would rather see 
the rebel die an hundred deaths, 
were it poesible, than that she 
should give such a villain as him 
a relation to my family. 

Well, but there is no room to

wears told sheis, let us send Mrs. 
Norton up to her. — That's the 
ieasi we can do — let us take her, 
however, out of the hands of that 
Belford. 

Both your uncles supported this 
motion ; the latter part of it espe- 

Your brother observed, in his 
ill-natured way, what a fine piece 
of consiateucy it was, in you, to 
refuse the vile injurer, and the 
amends he offered; yet to throw 
yourself upon the protection of his 

Miss Harlowe was apprehen-

to approve of it. But your brother 
dashed all. I hope, sir, said he, 
to bis father; I hope, madam, to 
his mother; that you irill not 
endeavour to recover a faulti 



ever my sister Clary darkens thes^ 
doors again, I never will. I will 
set out, madam, the same hour 
you go to London (on such an er- 
rand) to Edinburgh; and there 
I will reside; and try to forget 
that I have relations in England 
so near and so dear as you arenow 
all to me. 

Good God, said the colonel, 
what a declaration is this ! — And 
BUppoHe, sir, and suppose, ma- 
dam, [turning to your father and 
mother] this slimild be the case, 
whether is it better, think you, 
that you should loae for ever such 
a daughter aa my cousin Clarv, or 
that your sou should go to Ediu- 
hurgh, and reside there upon an 
estate which will be the better for 
for hia residence upon it. 

Youi' brother's passionate be- 
haviour hereupon is hardly to be 
described, ile reaented it aa pro- 
moting an alienation of the aaec-', 
tian oftbe family to him. Avdto' 



such a height wei'e resentments 
carried, every one siding with 
him, that the colouel, with hands 
and eyes lifted up, cried ont, what 
hearts of Sint am 1 related to! —

The colonel turned from . 
to draw out his handkerchief, and 
could not for a minute spealb Tbe 
eyea of every one but the hard- 
hearted brother, caught tosM 
from his. 

But then turning to them (with 
the more indignation, asitseemsd, 
as he had been obliged to ibews 
humanity, which, bowever, M 
bravo heart should be asbaiiHJ 
of) I leave ye all, said he, fit 
company for one another. Iwill 
never open my lips to any of you 
more upon this suDJeet. I willin- 
stantly make my will, and in wt

with me ; nor shall she return till 
ye know the value of sach

And saying this, he burned 
of the room, went into the oOOit- 
yard, and ordered his horse. 

Mr. Antony Hariowe went

of you all) that I will not again

of US one word to the other. At 
last she broke HJIence, asking me, 
if you were really and indeed bo 
illasit wasiaid you were? 

I answered in the affirmative; 
and would have shewn her your 
laat letter; but she declined Boe- 
ing it. 

Iwould fain have procured from 
her the favour of a line to yon, 
with her hleaaing. 1 asked, what 
was intended by your brother and 
sister? would nothine satisfy them 
but your final reprobation? — I 
insinuated, how easy it would be, 
did not your duty and humility 

fovem you, to make yourself in- 
ependent as to circumstances; 
but that nothing but a blessing, a 
last blesaing, was re quests Q by 
you. And many other things I 
urged in your behalf. The fol- 
lowing brief repetition of what she 
was pleased to say in answer to 
TQJ pleas, will give you a notion 
of it all; and of the present aitua- 
tionof tbings. 

She said, "She was very un- 
happy! — She had lost the little 
authority she once had over her 
other children, through one child's 
failing; and all iuSuence over Mr. 
Harlowe and bis brothers. Your 
father, she said, had besought her 
to leave it to hhn to take his own 
methods with you: and (as she 
valued him) to take no step in 
your favour nnknown to him and 
your uncles: yet she owned, that 
they were too much governed by 
your brother. They would, how- 
ever, give way in time, she know, 
toazeeoadliaitio^i: theydeaigaed| 



) other ; for they all still loved 



you. 

"Your brother and sister, she 
owned, were very jealousof your 
coming into favour aeain: yet 
could but Mr. Morden have kept 
his temper, and stood her son's 
first sallies, who (having alwayi 
had the family grandeur in view) 
had carried bis resentment h 
high, that be knew not how to 
descend, the conferences, so ab- 
ruptly broken off just now, wonid 
have endedmoTO happily; for tlut 
she had reason to think, that a 
few concessions on your part, 
with regard to your grandfatlier'i 

gaging for your submission 
from pro/ier motives, would bars 
softened them all. 

"Mr. Brand's account of your 
intimacy with the friend of the 
obnoxious man, she said, had, Sit 
very unhappy effectsr 
for before that she had gainea 
ground ; but afterwardi 
dared not, nor indeed had inclina- 
tion, to open her lips in youi be- 
half. Your continued intimaey 
with that Mr. Belford was wholly 
unaccountable, and as wholly ii 
excusable. 

"What made the wished-fbi 
reconciliation, she said, more dif- 
ficult, was, first, that you yooi- 
self acknowledged yourself «^ 
honoured (and it was too wdl 
known, that it was ^our own fault 
that you ever were m thi 
BO great a profligate) ; 
quence, that tbeu- and yoor dl>-<

pardon &nd bleaaing hoped for, 
mnst probably be Btteuiftd with 
TOnr marriage to the man they 
hate, and who hates them as 
much: very dia agreeable circum- 
stances, she said, I must allow, to 
found a reconciliation upon. 

"As to her own part, she must 
needs say, thatifthere were ajiy 
hope that Mr. Lovelace would 
become a, reformed man, the letter 
her cousin Morden had read to 
them from him to you, and the 
justice (as she hoped it was) he 
did your chamcter, though to his 
own condemnation (Mb family 
and fortunes being unexception- 
able) and all his relatioua earnent 
to be related to you, were argu- 
ments that would have weight 
with her, could they have any 
with your father and uncles." 

To my plea of your illness. 
" She could not but flatter herself, 
she answered, that it was from 
lowness of spirits, and temporary 
d^ection. A young creature, she 
■Bid, so very considerate as you 
naturally were, and fallen so low, 
must have enough of that. Should 
"^ey lose you, which God forbid! 
Bcene would then indeed be 
iy changed; for then those 
moat reaen ted, would be 



brance, and your unhappy eiTor 
woald be quite forgotten. 

" She wished you would put 
yourself into your cousin's protec- 
tion entirely, and have notbiug 
more to say to Mr. Belford." 

And I would recommend it

your most serious consideration, 
my dear Hiss Clary, whether now, 
aa your cousin (who is your 
trustee for your grandfauier's 
estate) is come, you should not 
give over all thoughta of Mr. 
Lovelace's intimate friend far 
your executor; more eipetnally, 
as that gentleman's interferius m 
the concerns of your family, 
ahould the sad event take place 
(which ray heart aches but to 
think of) might be attended with 
those consequences which you are 
so desirous, in other cases, to ob- 
viate and prevent. And suppose, 
my dear young lady, yon were to 
write one letter more to each of 
your unelea, to let them know 
how ill you are — and to ask their 
advice, and offer to be governed 
by it, in relation to the dispoaition 
ofyour estalo and effects? — Me- 
thinks I wish you would. 

1 find they will send you up a. 
large part of what has been re- 
ceived from that estate , since it 
was yours; together with your cur- 
rent cash, which you left behind 
you: and this by your cousin 
Morden , for fear you should have 
contracted debta which may make 
you nneasy. 

They seem to expect, that you 
will Wish to live at your grand- 
father's house, in a private man-

Nevertheless, in reading it, she 
was forced to leave off several 
times through weakness and a

complained; if 1 may say cnm-

She was very much affected at 
divers parto of this letter. She

When I was admitted to her

she , a long and not very pleasing 
letter from my dear Mrs. Norton. 
It will soon be in your bands. I 
am advised against appointiug 
you to the office you have so kind- 
ly accepted of: but you must re-

choice will have no odd appearance 
to them: but it is now too late to 
alterit, if I would. 

I woidd fain write an answer to 
it, continued she: but I have no

tineas however, will perhaps be

aa he finds, that she gave you 
advantage over her. But he for- 
beara to enter further into this 
subject, he says, till he has the 
honour to see her; and the rather, 
as she seems so much determined 
agatDst you. However, he cannot 
but say, that he thinks you a 
gallant man, and aman of sense; 
and that you have the reputation 
of being thought a generous man 
in every instance but where the 
aei is concerned. In gurJi, he 
owns, that you have taken inex- 
cusable liberties. And he is sorry 
to say, that there are very few 
young men of fortune but who 
allow themselves in the same. 
Both sexes, he observes , too much 
love to have each other in their 
power; yet he hardly ever knew 
manor woman, who was very fond 
of power, make a right use of it. 

"If she be so absolutely deter- 
mined against marrying you, as 
she declares she is. he hopes, he 
says, to prevail upon her to take 
(as soon as her health will permit) 
a little tour abroad with him, as 
what will probably establish it; 
since travelling is certainly the 
best physic for all those disorders 
wbicb owe their rise to grief or 
disappointment. An absence of 
two or three years will endear her 
to every one, on her return, and

And so, my friends, said she, have 
I heard of a patient who actually 
died, while five or six principal 
physicians were in a consultation, 
and not agreed upon what name 
to give his distemper. The patient 
was an emperor, Uie Emperor Jo- 
seph, 1 think. 

1 asked, if I should write to her 
cousin, aa he knew not how ill she 
was, to hasten up? 

By no means, she said ; since, if 
he were not already set out, she 
was persuaded that she should be 
so low by the time he could receive 
my letter, and come, that his pre- 
sence would but discompose and 
hurry her, and afflict him. 

I hope, however, she is uot so 
very near her end. And without 
saymgany more to her, when I 
retired, I wrotetoColonelMorden, 
that if he expects to see his beloved 
cousin alive, he must lose no time 
in setting oat. I sent this letter 
by his own servant.

Tarn urgencj of the case, and 
the opportunity by your servant, 
will Bufiiciently apofogize for this 
troahle from a stranger to your 
person; who, however, is not a 
stranger to yonr merit. 

I understand you are employ- 
ing your good offices, with the 
parents of MissClarissft Uarlowe, 
and other relations, to reconcile 
them to the most meritorious 
daughter and kinswoman that 
ever family had to boast of. 

Generously as this ia intended 
by you, we here have too much 
reason to think all your aolici- 
todea on this head will be un- 
necessary: for it is tlie opinion of 
every one who has the honour of 
being admitted to her preseoce, 
that she cannot live over three 
days: so that if you wish to see 
her alive, you must lose no time to 
come up. 

She knows not that I write. 1 
had done it sooner, if 1 had had 
the least doubt that before now 
dhe would not have received from 
yon some news of the happy 
effects of your kind mediation in 
bar behalf. I am, Sm,

three or four times a day, re-

ride back; and, in view of Ui-

Yesterday, in particular, to 
give you an idea of the strength 
of that imijatience, which! cannot 
avoid suffering to break out upon 
my servants , 1 h ad no sooner dis- 
patched Will, than I took horse 
to meet him on his return. 

In order to give him time, 1 
loitered abont on the road , riding 
up iMs lane to the one highway, 
down thai to the other, just as my 
horse pointed; all the way curaing 
my very being; and ihoiigh so 
lately looking duwn upon all the 
world, wishing to change condi- 
tionB with the poorest beggar that 
cried to me for charity as I rode 
by him — and throwing him 
money, in hopes to obtain Dj his 
prayers the blessing my heart 
pants after. 

After i had sauntered about an 
hour or two (which seeped three 
or four tedious ones) fearing I had 
alipt the fellow, 1 inquired at 
every turnpike, whether a servant 
in Bucb a livery had not passed

in so short ft compass! 

Yet all this time, though lonj

It was communicated to me by 
Mrs. Lovick; who had it to copy 
for me; but it was not to be de-

And pray let my Miss Uowe

ceive this, and she ymir significa-

I shall nevertheless love you,

it might have very happy effects 
upon the geutiemftn. 

I have DO lurking reBentment, 
air, said she — this is not st time 
for resentment; and you will be 
the readier to believe me, whenl 
can aseure you, (looking at me) 
that even what I have most re- 
joiced in, the truly friendly love 
that has so long aubsisted between 
my Misa Howe and her Clariasa, 
although to my last gasp it will 
be the dearest to me of all that 
IB dear in this life, has already 
abated of its fervour; has already 
given place to aupremer fervours : 
and ahall the remembrance of Mr. 
Lovelace 'a persona/ insults, which, 
IbteBs6o£ never corrupted that 
Toind which Aer friendship so much 
delighted, be atrongpr in these 
hours with me, than the remem- 
brance of a love as pure aa the 
human heart ever bo aa ted? Tell, 
therefore, the world, if you pleaae, 
ftnd, (if, Mr. Belfbrd, you think 
what I aaid to you before, not 
atrong enough) tell the poor man, 
that 1 not only forgive him, but 
have such earnest wishes for the 
good of his BOul, and that from 
considerations of its immortality, 
that could my penitence avail for 
more sins than my own, my last 
tear should fall for him by whom 
I die! 

Our eyes and hands expressed 
for us both, what our lips could 
not utter. 

Say not, then, proceeded she, 
nor let it be said, that my resent- 
ments are unsubdued I — And jet 
these eyes, lifted up to heaven aa 
to tbc truth of TOhat 1 have 



aaid, shaU never, if T can kelp 
it, behold him more! — For do 
you not consider, sirs, how short 
my time is; what much more im- 
portant subjects I have to employ 
it upon; and how unable 1 should 
be (so weak as I am) to contend 
even with the avowed penitence 
of a person in strong health, go- 
verned by paaaious unabated, and 
always violent? — And no 
hope, you will never urge me i 
on this subject. 

The minister said it were pi^ 
ever to urge this ptea again. 

You see, Lovelace, that I did, 
not forget the office of a inend, ia 
endeavouring to prevail ujKin hev 
to give you her last forgiveneu< 
personally. And I hope, as t*" 
is GO near her eud, you will i 
invade her in her last hours; sir 
she must be ejtremel^ disco 

posed at such an interview; a 

it might make her leave the world' 
the sooner for it. 

This reminds me of an exprea* 
sion which she used on your ba^' 
bai'ous hunting her at Smith's, on 
her return to her lodgings; and 
that with a serenity unexampled 
(asMrs. Lovicktoldme, consider- 
ing the occasion, and the trc 
given her by it, and her indispo- 
sition at the time): He will not 
let me die decently! said the ao'. 
geUc sufferer. — He will not lei, 
me enter into my Maker'H pra- 
sence, with the composure that 
is required in entering into the 
drawing-room of an earthly 
prince. 

1 cannot, however, forbear ta 
^ivish that the Leaveoly cteatorft

eonld have prevailed upon herBelf, 
in these her last hours, to see 
yon; and that for my sake, as 
■well as jours: for although I am 
deterraitied never to be guilty ol 
thecrimes, which, till witEin these 
few past weeks have blackeued 
mj former life ; and for which, at 
present, I moat heartily hate roj- 
aelf; yet should I be leaa appre- 
hensive of a relapse , if (wrought 
upon by the solemnity which suth 
an interview must have been at- 
tended with) you had become a 
reformed man; for no devil do 
Ifear, but one in your shape. 



It is now eleven o'clock at night. 
The tady, who retired to rest an 
hour ago, is, as Mrs. Lovick tells 
ni^ in a sweet slumber. 

I will close here. I hope I shall 
find her the better for it in the

from MisB Howe's, to whom he 
carried the lady's letter. The 
Htnpid fellow, being bid to make 
haste with it, and letnm as soon 
as poaaible, staid not till Miss 
Howe had it, she being at the dia- 
tanceof five miles, although Mrs, 
Howe would have had him atay, 
and sent a man and horse pur< 
poaelywith it to her daughter. 

Thb poor lady is just recovered 
from a fainting fit, which has left 
her at deatffa door. Her late 
tranquillity and freedom from 
pain, seemed but a lighlening, aa 
Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith

By my faith, Lovelace, I bad 
rather part with all the friends I 
have in the world, than with this 
lady. I never knew what a vir- 
tuous, a holy friendship, aalmay 
call mine U> her, was before. But 
to be BO neia to it, and to be 
obliged to forego it ao soon, what 
anaBlictiou! Yet, thank Heaven,

But 'twould be barbarous not to

death, in the same breath, with a 
view, no doubt, to distract me. 
How familiarly dost tfaou use the 
words, dying, dimness, tremor! 
Never did any mortal ring so 
many changes on bo few Sella, 
Thy true lather, I dare swear, waa 
a batcher, or an undertaker, by 
the delight thou seemest to take 
in sccnea of death and horror. 
Thy barbarous reflection, that 
thou loaest her not by thine own 
fault, is never to be forgiven. 
Thoa hast but one way to atone 
for the torments thou giveat me, 
and that is, by sending me word 
that she is better,and will recover. 
Whether it be true or not, let me 
be told so, and 1 will ^a abroad 
rejoicing and believing it, and my 
wishes and imagination ahall 
make out all the rest. 

If Bhe live but one year, that 
I may acquit myself lo myself 
(no matter for the world!) that 
her death is not owing to me, 1 
will compound for the rest. 

Will neither vows nor prayers 
save her! I never prayed in my 
life, put all the years of it to- 
gether, aa I have done for thia 
fortnight paat: and I have most 
eiucercly repented of all my base- 
ness to her — and will nothing 
do? 

But after all, if she recovernot,

MrB.Lovick to make many breaks 
in reading it, and many changes

She said, her dear friend was 

earnest for a line or two, that 
she fain would write, if she could: 
and she tried , but to no purpose; 
She could dictate, however, ebo 
believed; and desired Mrs. Lovicfc 
would take pen aodpaper. Which 
she did, and then ahe dictated to 
ker. I would have withdrawn; 
but at her desire staid. 

She wandered a good deal, at 
first. She took notice that she 
did. And when ahe got into a 
little train, not pleasing herself, 
she apologized to Mi's, Lovick 
for makin? her begin again and 
again; and said, that the third 
time should go, let it be as it 
would. 

She dictated the farewell part, 
without hesitation ; and when she 
came to the blessing and sub-

dropping on her knees, supported

of being one of the finest

She teas so, replied I, a very

to have confirmed those promises : 
for her features are so regular

— 'tis tine to send the letter 

ff^od Norton. 
[, madam, send oiy servant 
test witb it? 

', I thank you. It will 
reach the dear woman too soon 
(as she will think) by the post. 

I told her, this was not post 
day. 

Ib it Wednesday still, saidsbe? 
Bless me! I know not bow the time 
foes: bntvery tediously, 'tis plain. 
And now I think I must soon take 
to my bed. All will be most con- 
veniently, and with least trouble, 
over there — will it not, Mrs. 
LovickV — I think, sir, turning to 
me, I have left nothing to these, 
Iftst incapacitating hours. Nothing 
either to say, or to do. IblessGod, 
I have not. If I Aiiif, boiv unhappy 
shouldlbe? Can you, sir, remind 
me of any thing neceaaary to be 
done or aaid to make yonr office 

If, madam, yoar cousin Morden 
should come, you would be glad 
to see him, I presume? i 

1 am too weak to wish to aee my I 



293 

cousin uow. It would but dis- 
compoae me, and him too. Yet, if 
be come while I can see, I v>itl see 
him, were it but to thank him for 
former favours, and for bia present 
kind intentions to me. Has any 
body been here from him? 

lie has called, and will be here, 
madam, In half an houi; but he 
feared to surprise you. 

Nothing can surprise me now, 
eicept my mamma were to favour 
me with her last blessing in person. 
That would be a welcome surprise 
to me even yet. But did my 
cousin come purposely to town to 

Yes, madam. Itookthehberty 
to let him know, by a liue last 
Jlonday, bow ill you were. 

You are very kind, sir, I am, 
and have been greatly obliged to 
yon. But I think I ahall be pained 
to aee him now, because he will be 
concerned to aee me. And yet, as 
ill as I shall presently 



be-

, the 



chide me, very probably, and I 
cannot bear chiding now. Perhaps 
[leaning upon Mrs. Lovick and 
.Mrs. Smith] 1 can walk into the 
neit apartment to receive him. 

She motioned to rise; but naa 
ready to faint again, and forced 
to sitstill. ■ 

The colonel was in a perfect 
agitation behind the screen, to 
hear this discourse ; and twice, 
unseen by his cousin, was coming 
from it towardsher; but retreated, 
for fear of surprising her taii 
much,

For she heard somebody step 
softly cross the room, and thought 1 
it to be me; her hearing beingi

I told her, I believed be was; 
and sbe said, We most make the 
best of it, Mrs. Lovick, and Mrs.

for he loved me dearly once. Pray

to go d own to him, introduced the

that he might not see what was 
behind it; while be, having beard 
what she had said about it, was 
determined to take no notice of it. 
He folded the angel in his arms 
aa she sat, dropping down on one 
knee; for, supporting herself 
upon the two elbows of the chair, 
ahe attempted to rise, but could 
not. Excuse, my dear cousin, 
said she, excuse me, that I cannot

according to the wili I have 
written. Mr. Belford will eieuse 
me: but it was in truth more ne- 
cessity than choice, that made me 
thinkof giving him the trouble he 
so kindly aocepta. Had I had the 
happiness to see you, my cousin 
— aoooar — or to know that you 
stili honoured me with your re-- 
gard — I shontd not have had the 
aasuruice to ask this favour of 
lam. — But — though the friend 
of Mr. Lovelace, he is a man of 
honour, and he will make peace 
rather than break it And, my 
dear cousin, let me beg of you — 
to eontribute your part to it — 
and remember, that, while I have 
nearer relations than my cousin 
Alorden, dear as you are , and al- 
ways were to me, you haveno title 
to avenge my wrongs upon him 
who ihas been the occasion of 
them. But 1 wrote to you my 
mind on this subject, and my 
reasons; and 1 hope 1 need not 
filther urge them. 

ImustdoMr.Lovelaceso much 
justice, answered he, wiping hie 
eyes, as to witness, how sincerely 
be repents him of his ungrateful 
baseness to you, and how ready 
he is to make you all the amends 
in his power. He owns Au nicked- 
neea, and ynur merit. If he did 
not, 1 could not pass 
though you kace nearer relations: 
for, my dear cousin, did not your 
gfaudfather leave me in trust for 
yon? And should 1 think myuelf 
concerned for your fortune ' 

not for your honour? But 
he is so desirous to do you jn 
I have the less to say; and you 



295 

may make yourself entirely eaay 
on that account. 

I thank you, thank you, sir, 
said she; all is now as I wished: 
but I am *ery faint, very weak. I 
am sorry I cannot hold up; that 
I cannot better deserve the honour 
of this visit; but it will not be — 
and saying this, she sunk back in 
' 'r chair, and was silent. 

Hereupon we both withdrew, 
leaving word, that we would he at 
the Bedford Head, if any thing 
eitraordinary happened. 

We bespoke a litUe repast, 
having neither of us dined; and, 
while it was getting ready, you 
may guess at the subject of our 
discourse. Both joined in lament 
tation for the lady's desperate 
state: admired her manifold ex- 
cellencies: severely condemned 
, and her friends. Yet to 
ig him into better opinion of 
you , I read to him some passages 
from your last letters, which 
shewed your concern for the 
wrongs you had done her, and 
your deep remorse: and be said, 
It was a dreadful thing to labour 
under the sense of a guilt so irre- 
mediable. 

We procured Mr. &oddard [Dr. 
H. not being at home) once more 
to visit her, and call upon us in 
his return. He was so good as to 
do so; but he tarried withhernot 
five minutes; and told us, That 
she was drawing on apace; that 
he feared she would not live till 
morning; and that she wished to 
see Colonel Morden directly. 

The colonel made excuses whex.% 
none weve uteifti', wii "iuawfii.

we were both admitted. We ob- 
served in her, as soon as we en' 
tered, BtroDgr sjmptoa 
approaching aissolu tio n . 
Btandinc What the women had 
flattered ub witii from her last 
night's tranquillity. The colonel 
and I, each loth to saj what we 
thought, looked upon one another 
with melancholy countenances. 

The colonel told her. He should 
send a servant to her nncle An- 
tony's for some papers he had left 
tibere; and asked, If she had any 
commands that way? 

She thought not, sheaaid, speak- 
ing more inwardly than she did 
the day before. She had indeed 
a letter ready to be sent to her 
good Norton; and there was a re- 
quest intimated in it: but it was 
time enough, if the request were 
signified to those whom it con- 
cerned when all was over. How- 
ever, it might be scut then by 
the servant who was going thati 
way. Andshecausedit to begiven 
to the coionelforthat purpose. 

Her breath being very short, 
she desired another pdlow. Having 
two before, this made her in a 
manner sit up in her bed ; and she 
■poke then with more distinct- 
ness; and, seeing us greatly con- 
cerned, forgot her own suderings 
to comfort us; and a charming 
lecture she gave us, though a brief 
one, upon the happinessofatimely 
preparation, and upon the hazards 
L.0f a late repentance, when the 
■niod, as she observed, was bo| 
■Bucb weakened, as weil as the 
'ipdy, as to render a poor 30ul| 









, for herself On the con- 
trarv, rejoice with me, that all ray- 
worldly troubles are so near their 
end. Believe me, sirs, that I 
would not, if 1 might, choose to 
live, although the pTeasantest part 
of my life were to come over again : 
and yet eii/lileen ffearg of it, out of 
nineteen, have been uer^ pleasant. 
To be so much exposed to tempta- 
tion, and to be so liable to fail in 
the trial, who would not rejoice, 
that all her dangers are over! — 
All I wished was pardon and bless- 
ing from mj dear parents. Easy 
as my departure seems to promise 
to be, it would have been still 



She then repeated her request, 
in the most earoest manner, to her 
cotisin, that he would not heiifhien 
her fault, by seeking to avenge 
her death ; to in; , that 1 would en- 
deavour to make up all breaches, 
and use the power 1 had with my 
friend, to prevent all future mis- 
chiefa frnm him, aa well as that 
which this trust might give me, to 
prevent any lo him. 

She made some eicuses to her 
ci'iwiVi, for having not been able to 
alter her will, to join him in the 
executorehip with me; and to tiie 
for the trouble she had given, and 
yet should give me.

DRAK JACK, 

I SEND b^nAnrTwnrelAce's dssire, 

for«»^ MbreTiate 

i*-- }A, He 



yet wants to know every minute 
passage of Miss Harlowe's depar- 
ture. X et , why he should , I can- 
not see; for if she is^one, she is 
gone ; and who can help it? 

I never heard of such a woman 
in my life. What great matters 
has she suffered, that grief should 
kill her thus? 

I wish the poor fellow had nefer 
known her. From first to last, 
what trouble has she cost him! 
The charming fellow has been 
half lost to us ever since he pursaed 
her. And what is there in one 
woman more than another, for 
matter of that? 

It was well we were with him 
when your note came. Yo^ 
shewed your true friendship in 
your foresight. Why, Jack, the 
poor fellow was quite beside him- 
self — mad as any man ever was 
in Bedlam. 

Will brought him the letter just 
after we had joined him at the 
Bohemia Head; where he had left 
word at the Rose atKnightsbridge 
he should be; for he had been 
sauntering up and down, back- 
wards and forwards, expecting 
us , and his fellow. Will , as soon 
as he delivered it, got out of his 
way; and when he opened it,ne^ 
was such a pi^ce or scenery. He 
trembled like a devil at receiving 
it : fumbled at the seal , his &i^ 
in a palsy, like Tom Doleman'a: 
his hand shake, shake, shake, 
that he tore the letter in two, be- 
fore he could come at the con- 
tents: and, when he had read

rSC such like ezef.ralio'is wishes ; 
aniug up and donn the room, 
id tbrowiog up the sash, and 
tiling it down and smiting hie 
rorehead with his double fist, with 
snch force as would have felled an 
ox, and stamping and tearing, 
that the landlord ran in, and 
faster out again. And this was 
the distraclion scene for some time. 
In vain waa all Tourville or 1 
could Bavto him. I offered once 
to take bold of his hands because 
he was going to do himself a mis- 
chief, as I believed, looking about 
for his pistols, which hehad laid 
upon the table , but which Will, 
had taken oat with him 



and he hit me a d— n'd dowse 
— the chops, as made my nose 
bleed. 'Twas well 'twaa fie; for 
I hardlj knew how to take it. 

Jemmy raved at him , and told 
him, How wicked it was in him, 
to be BO brutish to abuse a Iriend, 
and run mad for a woman. And 
then he said, he was sorry for it; 
and then Will ventured in with 
water and a towel; and the dog 
rejoiced, as I could see by hia 
look, that I /idi' it rather than he. 

And BO , by degrees we brought 
bim a little to his reason, and he 
promised to behave more like a 
man. And sol forgave him: and 
we rode on in the dark to here at 
Doleman's. And we all tried to 
ahame him out of his mad un- 
for we 



verse woman tooi and how could 
he help it¥ 

And you know, Jack, (aa we 
told him, moreover) that it was a 
shame to manhood, for a man, 
who had served twenty and twenty 
wonen as bad or worse, let him 
have served Miss Harlowe never 
BO bad, sbonld give himself such 
iilmrropiituus ail's, because she 
would die: and we advised him 
never to attempt a woman proud 
of her character and u(>/fie,as they 
callit, anymore: forwhy? The 
comi^uest did not pay trouble; and

As I promised bim that I would 
write for the particulars above 
said, I write this after all 
are gone to bed ! and the fel- 
low is to set out with it by 
day- break.

mirable woman, whose soul is 
now rejoicing in the regioi "

lou may be glad to know the 
particulars of her happy exit. I 
will fry to proceed ; for all ie hush 
aud still; the family retired: but 
not one of them, and least of all 
her poor cousin , I dare say 

At four o'clock, as I meutioned 
in mj last, I was sent for down; 
and, as thou usedst to tike my de- 
scriptions, 1 will give thee tb4 
woeful scene that presented it- 
self to me, as I approached tho 

The colonel was the first that 
took my attention, kneeling oa 
the side of thebed, the lady's right 
band in both his with his face co- 
vered, bathing it with his i 
although she had been comfc . . ^, 
him, as the women since told me,, 
in elevated straius, but brokea) 
accents. 

On the other aide of the bed i 
the good widow; her face over-' 
whelmed with tears, leaning het 
head against the bed's head in a 
most disconsolate manner; 
turning her face to me as so 
she saw me, O, Sir. Belford, 
she, with folded hands — Th« 
dear lady — A heavy sob per- 
mitted her not to say more. 

I^Itb. Smith, with clasped fin*' 
gers, and uplifted eyes, asifim-' 
ploringhelp from the only power 
which could give it, was luieeling 
down by the bed's feet, tears m^ 
large drops trickling down hei 
cheeks. 
\ Het nurse was kneeling be- 



Etween the widow and Mra. Smith, I 
heranuB extended. In one hand 
she beld au ineffectual cordial, 
nrhicb she had just been offering | 
to her dying mistress; her face^ 
was swoln with weepine [though; 
lued to such sceuesas^is); and 
she turned her eyes towards me, 
&B if she called upon me, by tbem, 
to join in the helpless sorrow, a 
fresh stream bursting from tbcm 
as I approached the bed. 

The maid of the hanse with her 
foce upon her folded arms, as she 
stood leaning against the wain- 
scot, more audibly espreat her 
grief than any of the others. 

The lady had been silent a few 
minutes, and speechless as they 
thoaght, moving her lips without 
uttering a word; one hand, as J 
said, in her consin's. But when 
Mrs. Lorick on my approach pro- 
nounced my name, O! Mr. Bel- 
'ford, said she, with a faint in- 
ward voice, but very distinct 
nevertheless— Nowl — Now! [in 
broken periods she spoke] — I 
bless God for his mercies to his 
poor creature — will all soou be 
OTer — a few — a very few mo- 
ments — will end this strife — and 
I shall be happy. 

Comfort here, sir — turning her 
head to the colonel — comfort my 
cousin — see ! the blame — able 
kindness — he would not wish me 
to be happy — so soon/ 

Here she stopt, for two or three 
tninntes, earnestly looking upon: 
him: then resuming, My dearest 
cousin^ said she, be comforted — j

^ It is not so hard to die, as I be- 
lieved it to he! — The prepara- 
tion is the difficulty — I bless 
God, I have had time for that — 
the rest is worse to beholders, than 
to me ! — I am all blessed hope — 
hope itself. She looked what she 
-■■■'' '* .."."-^t smile beaming over 



After a short silence, Once more, 
my dear cousin, said she, butattll 
iu broken accents, commend me 
most dutifully to mj father and 
mother — there she stopt. And 
then proceeding — To my sister, 
to my brother, to my uncles — and 
tell them, 1 bless them with my 
parting breath ^ for all their 

Soodneas to me — even for their 
ispleaaure — I bless them —

She WAS silent for a few mo- 
ments, lifting up her eyes, and the 
hand her cousin held not between 
his. Then, deailil said she, 
where is Ihi/ fling ! [The wotdslre- 
member to have heard in the 
burial service read over my uncle 
and poor Belton]. And after a 
pause — It is good for me thai 1

Then turning towards ua, who 
were lost in speechless sorrow — 
O dear, dear gentlemen, said she, 
you know not what forelasles — 
what a!<^1ll^a^ice;t — and there she

motnonts: and then resuming — 
My night fails mo ! — Your voices

Ood Almighty bless you both,

She paused again, her breath 
giH) wing shorter; ana, after a few j 
mlnuttvi, And now, my dearest; 
oouiiin, give me your hand — j 
noartu* — still nearer — drawing I 
it towanls her; and she pressed it ^ 
with her dving lips — God protect !

I't^oeivo my best and most grateful , 
thanks -- and tell mv dear Miss'

to tell my wortliy Norton — she

now lowly in her fortunes^ a saint 
in heaven — tell them both, that I ! 
remember them with thankful 
blessings in my last moments! — ; 
And pray God to give them hap- [ 
piness here for many, many years, ' 
for the sake of their friends and 



lovers; and an heavenly crown 
hereafter; and such assurances of 
it, as I have, through the all-satis- 
fying merits of my blessed Ke- 
deemer. 

Her sweet voice and broken pe- 
riods, methinks, still fill my ears, 
and never will be out of my me- 
mory. 

After a short silence, in a more 
broken and faint accent — And 
you, Mr. Belford, pressing my 
hand, may God preserve you, and 
make you sensible of all your er- 
rors — you see, in me, how all 
ends — may you be — and down 
sunk her head upon her pillow, 
she fainting away, and drawing 
from us her hands. 

We thought she was then gone; 
and each gave way to a violent 
burst of grief. 

But soon shewing signs of re- 
turning life, our attention was 
again engaged; and I besought 
her, when a little recovered, to 
complete in my favour her half- 

g renounced blessing. She waved 
er hand to us both, and bowed 
her head six several times, as we 
have since recollected, as if dis- 
tinguishing every person present; 
not forgetting the nurse and the 
maid-servant; the latter having 
approached the bed, weeping, as 
it crouding in for the divine la^s 
last blessing; and she spoke w- 
tering and inwardly — Bless — 
bless — bless — you all — and — 
now — and now — [holding up 
her almost lifeless hands for the 
last time] Come — come — 
blessed Lord — Jescs! 
• And with these words, the last 



but half- pronounced, eipirert: — 
euchaatnile, such a charming se- 
renity overspreading her ewoet 
face at the imtant, as seenied to 
manifeet her eternal hMppineas al- 
ready begOD. 

Lovelace! — Bat I can write 



While warm, though pulse less, 
we pressed each her band with our 
lips; and then retired into the 
next room. 

We looked at each other, with 
intent to speak: but, as if one 
motdoQ governed, as one cause 
affected Doth, we turned away 
iilenl. 

The colonel aighed as if hia 
ieart would burst; at last, his face 
Bad bands uplifted, his back to- 
.vardame, GoodUeavim! said he 
tnhiiDBelt, support me! — And is 
itthuB,0 flower of nature! — Then 
jwosing — And must we no more 
: — Never mnrel — My blessed, 
tileiMd; cousin! uttering some 
[•tJier words, which his sighs made 
'inarticulate; — and then, as if 
recollecting himself — Forgive 
me, sir! — Eicnae me, Mr. Bel- 
ford! And, aliding by me, Anon 
tl hope to see you, sir — and down 
■tatrs he went, and out of the 
bonse, leaving me a statue. 
When I recovered, 1 was ready 
to repine at what I Ihen called an 
niicanal dispensation; forgetting 
her nappy prcpuratioa, and stth 
happier departure; and that she 
bad bat drawn a common lot; 
tiiiunpfaing in it, and leaving be-

liappinesa, though equally certain 
that the lot wouldono day be their 

She departed exactly at forty 
mioutes after six o'clock, as by her 
watch on the table. 

And thus died Miss CLAuisiiA 
iliRLowB, in the blossom of her 
youth and beauty: and who, her 
tender ^ears considered, has not 
left behmd her her superior in ex- 
lensiveknowtedge, and watchful 
]irndence; nor hardly her equal 
for unblemished virtue, exemplary 
piety, sweetnessofmannm, dis- 
creet generosity, and true Cbrii- 
tlan charity: and these all set off 
by the most graceful modesty and 
humility; yet on all proper oc- 
casions, manifesting a noble pre- 
sence of mind , and true magnani- 
mity: so that she may he said to 
lave been not only an ornament 
to her sex, but to human nature. 

A better pen than mine may do 
her fuller justice. Thine, I mean, 
O Lovelace! For well dost thou 
know how much she excelled in 
the graces both of mind and per- 
son, natural and ac(|uired,all that 
is woman. And thou also canst 
best account for the causes of her 
immature death, through those 
calamities which in so short a 
space of time, from the highest 
pitch of felicity (every one in a 
manner adoring her,) broneht ber 
to an exit so Sappy for herwl^

it would be presumption to have 
asked for it: and to-morrow a

Your uncle Harlowe will also 
write, and (I doubt not) in the 
kindest terms: for they are all ex- 
tremely alarmed and troubled at 
the dangerous way your doctor 
represents yon to be in ; as wel! as 
delighted with the character he

I WILL now take np the account 
of our proceedings, from my 
letter of last night, which con- 
tained the dying words of this in- 
comparable lady. 

As soon as we had seen the last 
scene closed (bo blessedly for her- 
selN) we left the body to the care 
of the good woman, who, ac- 
cording to the orders she had 
given them that very night, re- 
moved her into that last house 
which she had displayed bo much 
fortitude in providiug. 

In the moming between seven 
and eight o'clock, according to 
appointment, the colonel came to 
me here. He was very much in- 
disposed. We went together, ac- 
companied hy Mrs. Lovick and 
Mrs. Smith, into the deceased's 
chamber. We could not help 
taking a view of the lovely 
corpse, and admiring the charm- 
ing serenity of her noble aspect. 
The women declared, the^ «.«*«=

Abandoning, therefore, a sub-

yon, sir, that my next motive for

to forego any active " " ' '

For, ought au innocent man to

the arts of offence?

Leave then the poor wretch to 
the divine justice. Let your sister's 
fault die with her. At least, let it 
not be revived in blood. Idfe is a 
short stage where longest. Alittle 
time hence, the now green head 
will be grey, if it lives this little 
time: and if Heaven will afford 
him time for repentance, why 
should not jou.* 

Then think, mybrother, what 
will be the consequence to your 
dear parents, if the guilty wretch 
who has occasioned to them the 
loss of a daughter, should likewise 
deprive them of their best hope, 
an only son, more worth in the 
family account than several 
daughters? 

Would you add, mybrother, to 
those distresses which you hold 

Jour sister so ineicuaable for 
aving (although from involuutary 
and undesigned causes) given? 

Seek not then, I beseech yon, 
to extend the evil consequences of 
your sister's error. His conscience 
when it shall please God to touch 
it, will be sharper than your 

I have Qtill another motive for 
writing to you in this solemn 
manner: it is, to entreat you to 
watch over your passions. The 
principal fault I knew you to ba 
guilty of, is, the violence of your 
temper when you think yourself 
in the right; which you would 
oftener be , but for that very vi 
lence.

THE HISTORY OF 



It is easy then to judge what 
must be their grief and eurpriae 
on receiving the fatal newa which 
the letter llRrry seat in to them 
commnnicated. 

He Btuid there long enough to 
find the whole house in confuaion; 
the Bervanta running different 
ways ; lamenting and wringing 
their handa as tbeyran; the feniale 
BerrantB particularly; as if some- 
body (poor Mrs. Harlowe, no 
douot, and perhaps Mrs. Herrey 
too) were in fits. 

Every one wag in each disorder, 
that he coold get no commauds, 
nor obtain any notice of himself. 
The servants seemed more inclined 
to execrate than welcome him — 
O master! young man! cried 
three or four together, what dis- 
mal tidings have you faroughtl 
They helped him , at the very first 
word, to his horaej which with 
great oivility they had put up on 
hisarriTal: and he went to an inu; 
and pursued oq foot his way to 
Mrs. Norton's; and finding her 
come to town, left the letter he 
carried down for her with her 
(a fine youth); who, when he 
heard the fatal news, burst out 
intoafiood of tears^first lament- 
ing the lady's death, and then 
crying out, what, what, would 
become of his poor mother! — 
How would she support herself, 
when she should find, on her ar- 
rival in town, that the dear lady, 
who was 80 deservedly the darling 
of lier heart, was no more! 

He proceeded to Miss Howe's 
with the letter for her. That lady, 
he was told, bad just given orders 




young man, a tenant's 
5t toXondon, to bring hajj 
of her dear friend's coir 
dition, and whether she shoiiU 
herself be encouraged, byanao 
count of her being still alive, tOT 
make hera visit; every thing braog 
ordered to be in readiness for hei 
going up, on his return with the 
news she wished and prayed fol 
with the utmost impatience. And 
Harry wasjust in time, to prerSnt , 
' setting out. 

the precaution to dwirt | 
to speak with Misa Howe's wona 
maid, and communicated t 
r the fatal tidings, that tb 
ght break them to her ) — 
lady. The maid herself w 
affected, that her old lady (vbo 
Harry said, seemed to be ««; 
where al once) came to see whi 
ailed her; and was herself • 
struck with the communicatiiOi 
that she was forced tositdowubi 
O the sweet creatnrt! 
said she — and is it come to tluil 
— O mypoorNaucyl — HowihaH 
1 be able to break the matter toinj 
Nancy! 

Mr. Hickman was in the hous^ 
He hastened in to comfort the oB' 
lady — but he could not restrt 
his own tears. He feared, 
said, when he was last in tovl^' 
that this sad event would l"~ 
happen : but little tbDueht itwo 
be so very soon I — but she i 
happy, I am sure, said thegooi 
gentleman. 

Mrs. Howe, when a Uttle n 
covered, went up, in order t 
break the news to her daughta 
She took Oie letter, andberaR"^^ 



in her hand. And thej ha.d 
caaion for the latter; for the' 
hoHBekeeper ho on came hurrying 
down into the kitchen, ber face 
orerapread with tears— her young 
mlBtresa had fainted away , she 
said — nor did she wonder at it — 
never did there live a, lady more 
deEervjng of general admiration 
and lamentation, than Misa Cla- 
rissa Haclowe! and never waa 
there a stronger friendahip dis- 
solved by death than bctw^een her 
young lady and her. 

She hurried with a lighted wax 
candle , and with feathers, to burn 
oitder the noae of her young mia- 
tresa; which shewed that she con- 
tinned in fits. 

Mr. Hickman afterwards , with 
his ntnal humanity , directed that 
Harry ahonld be taken care of all 
night; it being then the clone of 
the day. He asked him after my 
health. He eipreased himself ei- 
cessively afHicted, as well for the 
death of the most eiccllent of wo- , 
men, as for the just grief of the 
lady, whom he to paaaionately |

the diatress which the first com-

The answer which James Har< 
lowe returned to Colonel Morden's 
letter of notification of his aiater's 
death, and to her reijueat as to 
her interment, will give a faint 
idea of what their concern mwit 
be. — Here follows a copy of it. 



I cANHOT find words to express 
what we all suffer on the moat 
mournful news that ever was com- 
municated to us. 

My sister Arabella (but, alas! 
1 have now no other alslcr) was 
preparing tu follow Mrs. Norton 
up; and 1 had resolved to escort 
her, and to have looked in upon 
the dear creature. 

God be merciful to ns all ! To 
what purpose did the doctor write, 
if she was ao near her end? — 
Why, as every body says, did 
he not send sooner? — or wby, 
at aUV 



friend to be with her! — Alas!

thing but the hoaour of the fa- 
milTi 76t have I oU the weight 
thrown upon me — [O this cursed 
Lovelace! may I perish if he 
escape the deserved venceance!]'' 

We had begun to pfease oui 
Helves that we should soon see be 
here — good Ueaveu! that her 
neit entrance into this house, 
after she abandoned us so pre- 
cipitately, should be in a coffin. 

We can have nothing to do with 
her executor: (another strange 
step of the dear creature's!) he 
cannot eipect we will — nor , if he 
be a gentleman, will be think of 
acting. Do you therefore be 
pleased, sir, to order the under- 
taker to convey the body^ down to 
OS. My mother says, she shall 
be for ever unhappy, if she may 
not in death see the dear creature 
whom she could not see in life: be 
so kind therefore as to direct the 
lid to be only half-screwed down 
— that (if my poor mother cannot 
beprevailed upon to dispense with 
so shocking a spectacle) she may 
be obliged — she was the darling 
of her heart I 

If we know her will in relation 
to the funeral , it shall be punctu- 
ally complied with: as shall every 
thing in it that is fit or reasonable 
to be performed ; and this without 
the intervention of strangers. 

Will you not, dear sir, favour

Poor Mrs. Norton is eitremely

in a mourning chariot) to take

We have got Lord M. to him,

at the lady's death. Hia sisters 
and nieces, he says, will be ready 
to break their hearts. What a

after all, she was no more.

is full as deep as for a wife) was 
brought home, and his fellows' 
mourning too. And, though eight 
o'clock, he would put it 00, and 
make them attend him in theire. 

Every body blames him on the 
lady's account. But I see not for

OK, UibridgB.Ssi. Sept. 

I THINK it absolutely right that 

y ever dear and beloved ladv 

■houldbe opened and embalmea. 

It mast be done out of hand — 

this very afternoon. Your ac- 

Joaintance Tomkins, and old An- 
eraon of this place, whom I will 
bring with me, shall be the sur- 
geons, I have talked to the latter 
about it. 

I will see every thing done with 
that decorum which the case, and 
the sacred person of my beloved, 

£very thing that can be done to 
preserve the charmer from decay, 
shall also be done. And when she 
tuill descend to her original dust,' 
or cannot he kept longer, I wilt 
then have her laid in my family[ 



vault, between my own father and 
mother. Myself, as I am in my 
sW, so in ptr.suii, chief mourner. 
But her heart, to which 1 have 
such unquestioaablc pretensions, 
in which 1 had once so iarge a 
share, and which I will prize a- 
bove my own, I leill have. I will 
keepitmspiritfl. It shall never be 
out of my sight. And all the 
charges of sepiilline too shall be 

Surely nobody will dispute my 
right to her. Whose was she 
living? whose is she dead, bat 
mine? — Her cursed parents, 
whose barbarity to her, no doubt, 
was the tnie cause of her death, 
have long since renounced her. 
She left Ih/m for me. She chose 
me, therefore ; and I was her hus- 
band. What though I treated 
her like a villain? Do I not pay 
for it now? Would she not have 
been mine had I not? Nobody will 
dispute but she would. And has 
she not forgiven me? — I am then 
in sfalu quo pmis with her — am I 
not? — as if I had never offended? 
Whose then can she be but mine ? 

I will free you from your ejecu- 
torship, and all your cares. 

Take notice, tieiford, that I do 
hereby actually discharge you 
and every body, from all cares 
and troubles relating to her. And 
us to her last testament, I will 
eiecute it myself. 

There were no articles between 
us, no settlements; and she is 
mine, as you see I have proved to 
a demonstration; nor could she 
dispose of hcHKiK b'o.'i. aa\-^^M^^

I will take her papers. And, as 
no one can do her memory justice

And the worid shall also see, what

I HATK Toare, with our unbappj 
friend's inclosed. I am glad mj 
lord is with him. As I presome 
tbat his phrensj will be but of 
■hort coDtiDuance, I most earnest- 
ly wish, that on his recovery he 
could be prevailed upoQ to go 
abroad. Mr. Morden, who is in- , 
consolable, boa seen by the will 
(as indeed he suspected before he 
read it) that the case was more 
than a common seduction; and 
has dropt hints already, that be 
looks upon himself, on that ac- 
count, as freed from his prom iseB 
made to the dying lady, which 
were, that he would not seek to 
avenge her death. ' 

You must make the recovery of 
his health the motive for urging 
himon this head; for, if you hint 
at his own safety, be will not stir, 
but rather seek the colonel. 

As to the lock of hair, you may 
easily pacify him (as you once 
saw the angel) with hair near the 
colour, if he be latent upon it. 

At my lord's desire I will write, 
on, and in my common band ; that: 
you may judge what is, and what 
IS not, fit tone read to Mr. Love- 
lace at present. But as I shall not 
■ forbear reflections as 1 go along, 
iu hopes to reach his heart on his 
recovery, I think it best to direct 
myself to him still; andthatasif 
be were not disordered. 

As I shall not have leisure to 
take copies, and yet am willing to 
' sthe wJioIe subject beforemc, 



for my own future cont«mplatiou; 
1 must inrist upon a return of mj' 
letters sometime hence. Mr.Love* 
lace knows that this is one of my 
conditions; and has hitherto com- 
plied with it. 

Thy letter, Mowbray, is

task, which I had for some time 
past resolced to begja; that is to 
say, Ui go to church i and see if 1 
could not reap Bome henefit from 
what I should hear there. Ac- 
cordioKlj I determined to go to 
hear the celebrated preacher at 
St James's Church. But, as if the 
devil (for so I mas then ready to 
conclude) thought himself uon- 
ceroed to prevent my iuteution, a 
visit was made me, just as I was 
dreesed, which took me off from 



but from Sally Martia, accom- 
panied by Mrs. Carter, the sister 
of theinfamousSinelairl the sane, 
1 suppose I need not telt you, who 
keeps the Bagnio near Blooma- 

They t«ld me that the surgeou, 
apothecary, and physician, had all 

given the wretched womau o^ 

but that she said, she could 
die, nor be at rest, till she saw 
and they besought roe to acc' 
pauy them in the coach they ci 
in, if I had one spark of charity, of 
Chrislian charity, as they called 
it, left. 

I was very loth to he diverted 
from my purpose by a request bo 
unwelcome, and from people ao 
abhorred; but at last went, and 
we got thither by ten, when; a 
scene so shocking presented itself 
tome, thattheaei" ' "" "' 
spending Beiton is 
be compared with it. 

The old wretch had once put 
her leg out by her rage and 
violence, and had been crying, 
scolding, cursing, ever since the 



preceding evening, that the snr- 
geon had told her it was impos- 
sible to save her; andthatamor- 
tiScation had begun to shew it- 

"■ ' lomuch tnat, purely in 
compassion to their own e/in, they 
had been forced to send for an- 
other surgeon, purposely to tell 
her, thougli against his judgment, 

id (being a friend of the other)to 

em to convince hitit, that he mis- 
look her ease; and that if she 
would be patient, she might re- 
cover. But, nevertheless, her ap- 
prehensions of death, and her 
antipathy to the thoughts of dy- 
ing, were so strong, that their im- 
posture had not the intended 
effect, and she was raving, crying, 
cursing, and even howling, more 
like a wolf than a human creature, 
wheu I came ; so that as I went up 
stairs, 1 said. Surely this noise, 
this howling, cannot be from the 
unhappy woman! Sally said it 
was: and assured me. that it was 
nothing to the noise she had made 
all night; and stepping into her 
room before me, Dear Mi if awi Sin- 
clair, said she, forbear this noise! 
It is more like that of a bull than 
a woman! — Here comes Mr. Bel- 
ford; and you'll fright him away 
if you bellow at this rate. 

There were no less than eight 
of her cursed daughters surronnd- 
iug her bed when I entered; one 
ofher partners, Polly Horton, at 
their head; aud now Sally, her 
other partner, and Madam Carter, 
aa they called her (for they are all 
irad'iama with one another), made 
the number ten; all in shocking 
dishabille, and without sta.'j«.,'i^i--

'^ler miEfoTtime has not at all 
ik , but rather, as 1 thought, in- 
reased her flesh; rage and vio- 
Bice perhaps swellitig her mua- 
.nlar features. Behold her then, 
tpreadiug the whole tumbled bed 
^th her huge quaffgy carcase: 
t mill-poHt arms held up; her 
road hands clenched with via- 
; her big eyea, goggling and 
. ng red as we may suppose 
thoseof a salamander: her matted 



dress being half otF, spread about 
her fat ears and brawny neck); 
her livid ijps parched, and work- 
ing riolently; her broad chin 
in conTulsive motion ; her wide 
mouth , by reason of the contrac- 
tion of her forehead (which aeemed 
to be half lost in its own frightful 
furrows) splitting her face, as it 
were into two parts ; and her huge 
toogne hideously rolling in it; 
heaving, puffing asif for breath; 
her bellows- shaped and various 
coloured breasts ascending by 
turns to her chin, and descending 
out of sight with the violence of 
her saBpings, 

This was the spectacle, as re- 
collection has enabled me to de- 
scribe it , that this wretch made to 
iny eye, when I 



by her suffragans and daughters, 
«no surveyed her wiih scouling 
frighted attention , which one 
might easily see had more in it of 
horror and self-eoneem (and setf- 
condemnoiion too) than of lore or 
pity; as who should say, See! 
what wo ourselves must one 
day be ! 

As soon as she saw me, herna- 
tnraliy big voice , more hoarsened I 

by her ravings, broke upon me; 
O, Mr. Belfordl 0, sirl see what 
1 am come to! — See what I am J 
brought to! — To have such a 
cursed crew about me, and not 
one of them to take care of me! 
But to let me tumble down stairs 
so distant from the room I went 
from I so distant from the room I 
meant to go to! Cursed, cursed 
be every Cftreleas devil! — May 
this or worse be their fate , every 
one of them! 

And then she cursed and swore 
moat vehemently, and the more, 
as two or three of them were ex- 
cusing tbemselves on the score of 1 
their being at that time as unable 
to help themselves as she. As 
soon as she had cleared the pas- , 
sage of her throat by the oaths 
and curses which her wild im- 
patience had made her utter, she 
began in a more hollow and 
whniing strain to bemoan herself. 
And here, said she — Heaven 
grant me patience! [clenching 
and unclenching her hands] ami 
to die thus miserably! — of a 
broken leg in my old age! — 
snatched away by means of my 
ownintemperancal Self-do! Self-

THE HISTORY OP 



signs of ignorant wonder in their 
faces, as there appeared of ««//*- 
sufficiency in those of the artists,) 
(lia they by turns £11 my ears with 
an anatomical description of the 
leg and thigh; running over with 
terms of art, of the tarsus, the 
metatarsus, the tibia, the fibula, the 
patella, the os tali, the os tibicB, the 
tibialis posticus and tibialis anticus, 
up to the OS femoris, to the ace- 
tabulum of the OS ischion , the great 
trochanter , glutcms , triceps, lividus, 
and Utile rotators ; in short, of all 
the muscles, cartilages, and bones, 
that constitute the leg and thigh, 
from the great toe to the hip; 
as if they would shew me, that 
all their science had penetrated 
their heads no further than their 
mouths ; while Sally lifted up her 
hands with a — Laud bless me! 
are all surgeons so learned! — 
But at last both the gentlemen 
declared, that if she and her 
friends would consent to amputa- 
tion , they would whip off her leg in 
a moment. 

Mrs. Carter asked, to what pur- 
pose , if the operation would not 
save her? 

Very true, they said, but it 
might be a satisfaction to the pa- 
tient's friends , that all was done 
that could be done. 

And so the poor wretch was to 
be lanced and quartered, as I may 
say, for an experiment only! And, 
without any hope of benefit from 
the operation, was to pay the sur- 
geons for tormenting her! 

I cannot but say 1 have a mean 
opinion of both these gentlemen, 
vbo, though they make a flguve, it 



seems, in their way of living, and 

boast not only French extraction, 

; but a Paris education, never will 

! mUke any in their practice. 

I How unlike my honest English 

\ friend Tomkins , a plain , senons, 

intelligent man, whose art lies 

deeper than in words ; who always 

avoids parade and jargon ; and 

endeavours to make every one as 

I much a judge of what he is about 

as himself! 

All the time that the surgeons 
ran on with their anatomical pro- 
cess, the wretched woman most 
frightfully roared and bellowed; 
which the gentlemen (who shewed 
themselves to be of the class 
of those who are not affected 
with the evils they do not 
feel) took no other notice of, than 
by raising tfieir voices to be heard^ 
as she raised hers — being evident- 
ly more solicitous to increase their 
acquaintance, and to propagate 
the notion of their skill, than to 
attend to the clamours of the poor 
wretch whom they were called in 
to relieve; though by this very 
means, like the dog and the 
shadow in the fable, they lost both 
aims with me : for I never was de- 
ceived in one rule , which I made 
early ; to wit, that the stillest water 
is the deepest , while the bubbling 
stream only betrays shallowness; 
and that stones and pebbles lie 
there so near the surface, to point 
out the best place to ford a river 
dry shod.

happy wretch what every one ap- 
prehended must follow, and what

the moment 1 entered the 
F*treet. 

' Nor is it to he wondered at, 
when it ia considered, that to the 
ill amelis that will he al-

physician comes, the air is shut

for one or other of the crea

gripes, or qualms, were conti-

all the time 1 waa there. And yet 
this is thought to be a genteel 
bonseof the sort: and all the pro- 
stitutes in it are prostitutes o< 
price', and their visitors people of 
note. 

0, Lovelace! what lives do 
most of us rakes and libertines 
lead! What company do^vekeepl 
And, for such company what so- 
ciety renounce, or endeavour to 
make like these! 

What woman, nice in ^ . 
son, andof purity in her mind and 
manners, did she know what miry 
wallowers the generality of menof 
oar class are m themselves , and 
constantly trough and sty with, 



hut would detest the thoughts of 
associating with such fillhy sen- 
aualiafs, whose favourite taste oar- 
them to mingle with the dregs 
of stews, brothels, and common 
sewers? 

Yet to such a choice are many 
worthy women betrayed, by that 
false inconsiderate notion, raised 
and propagated , no doubt , by the 
author of all delusion, Ihal a re- 
formed rake makes Ihe hesl husband. 
We rakes , indeed , are bold 
enough to suppose, that women in 
general are as much rakes in their 
hearts, as the libertines, some of 
them, suffer themselves to he 
taken with, are in their practice. 
A supposition , therefore , which it 
behoves persons of true honour of 
that sex to discountenance, by re- 
jecting the address of every man, 
whose character will not stand the 
test of that virtue which is the 
glory of awoman: and, indeed, I 
may say, of a man too: why 
should it not? 

How, indeed, can it be, if this 
point beduly weighed, thata man, 
who thinks alike of all the sex, and 
knows it to be in the power of a 
wife to do him the greatest dis- 
honour man can receive, and 
doubts not her will to do it, if dd- 
poriumty offer , and importumtyl/e 
not wanting: that £tic7i a one, from 
principle, should be a good hus- 
band to mty woman? And, in- 
deed, little do innocents think, 
what a total revolution of manners, 
vhat a cluini/e of fixed haliiti , nay, 
what a conquest of a bad nature,

of my own experience) thou,Love- 
Uee, bast found in the progress of 
thy attempts upon the divine Mies 
Harlone. For whose remorses 
could be deeper, or more frequent, 
yet more transient than thine! 

Now, Lovelace, let me know if 
the word giace can be read from 
my pen, without a aneer from thee 
aud thy associates? 1 own that 
once it sounded oddly in mi/ ears. 
But I shall never forget what a 
grave man once said on this very 
word — that with him it was a

hopes of one who could bear tie 
mention of it without ridiculing 
it; and ever gave him up for an 
abandonedman, whomadeajest

and audibly sobbed. 

Miaa Arabella followed her 
uncle Antony, as he walked in

would have spoken to the pierced 
mother some words of comfort. 
But she was unable to utter them, 
and got behind her mother'scbair; 
and inclining her face over it, 
on the unhappy lady's shoulder, 
seemed to claim the consolation 
that indulgent parent used, but 
then was unable , to afford her. 

Young Mr. Harlowe, witb all 
his vehemence of spirit, was now 
subdued. His self-reproaching 
doubt, was the 



cause of it

had kept up the general resent- 
ment against so sweet a creature- 
While he waa hardly able 1o bear 
his own remorse: nor Miss Har- 
lowe hersi she breaking out into 
words. How tauntingly did I write 
to her! How barbarously did I in- 
sult herl Yet how patiently did 
■be take it! — Who would have 



but for yii}i! — but for gou! 
Double uot upon me, said he, my 
own woes! I have every thing be- 
fore me tfaatbas passed! I thought 
only to reclaim a dear crea' — 
that bad erred! I intended n< 
break her tender heart! But it 
was the villainous Lovelace who 
did that — not any of iis! Yet, 
cousin, did she not attribute all 
tome?— I fear she did! — Tell 
me only, did she name me, did she 
gpealc of me, in her last hours? I 
—.iope she, who could forgive the 



345 

greatest villain on earth, and 
plead that he may be safe from 
our vengeance, I hupe she could 
forgive ijie. 

She died blessing you all; and 
justified rather than condemned 
your severily to her. 

Then they set up another gene- 
ral lamentation. We see, said her 
fRther,cnough we sec in her heart- 
piercing letters touB, what a happy 
frame she was in a few days be- 
fore her death — but did it hold to 
the last? Had she no repinings? 
Had the dear child no heart- 
burnings? 

None at all ! — I never saw, and 
never shall see, so blessed a de- 
parture: aud no wonder; for I 
never beard of such a. preparation. 
Every hour, for weeks together, 
was taken up in it. Let this be 
our comfort; we need only to wish 
for BO happy an end for ourselves, 
and for those who are nearest to 
our hearts, Wemay any of usbe 
grieved for acts of unkindness to 
her: hut had all happened that 
once she wished for, soe conid not 
have made a happier, perhaps not 
ao happy an end. 

Dear soul! and dear sweetEoull 
the father, uncles, sister, my cousia 
Hervey, cried out all at once, in 
accents of anguish ineipressibly 
affecting. 

We must for ever be disturbed 
for those acts of unkindneas to ao 
sweet a child, cried the unhappy 
mother, — Indeed ! indeed! [aottly 
to her sister Hervey] I have been 
too passive, much too passive, in 
this case ! — The temporary quiet 
I have been bo studious all mj li£% 



346 



THE HISTORY OF 



to preserve, has cost me everlast- 
ingdisquiet! — There she stopt. 

Bear sister! — was all Mrs. 
Hervey could say. 

I have done but half my duty to 
the dearest and most meritorious 
of children, resumed the sorrowing 
mother! — Nay, not half! — flow 
have we hardened our hearts 
against her! — Again her tears 
denied passage to her words. 

My dearest, dearest sister ! again 
was all Mrs. Uervey could say. 

Would to Heaven , proceeded, 
exclaiming, the poor mother, I had 
but once seen her! Then, turning 
to my cousin James, and his sister 

— my son! my Arabella! If 
WE were to receive as little mercy 

— and there again she stopt, her 
tears interrupting her further 
speech J every one, all the time, 
remaimng silent; their counten- 
ances shewing a grief in their 
hearts too big for expression. 

Now you see, Mr.JBelford, that 
my dearest cousin could be allowed 
all her merit! — What a dreadful 
thing is after-reflection upon a con- 
duct so perverse and unnatural, 

this cursed friend of yours, 
Mr. Belfprd ! This detested Love- 
lace! — To him, to him is owing — 
pardon me , sir. I will lay down 
my pen till I have recovered my 
temper. 

One in the morning. 

In vain, sir, have I endeavoured 
to compose myself to rest. You 
wished me to be very particular, 
and I cannot help it. This melan- 
choly subject fills my whole mind. 
I will proceed , though it be mid- 
"light 



About six o'clock the hearse 
came to the outward gate — the 
parish-church is at some distance; 
but the wind setting fair, tiie 
afflicted family were struck. Just 
before it came, into a fresh ntof 
grief, on hearing the funeral bell 
tolled in a very solemn manner. 
A respect, as it proved, and as they 
all guessed, paid to the memory of 
the dear deceased, out of officious 
love, as the hearse passed near the 
church. 

Jud^e , when their ^ief was so 
great m expectation of it , what it 
must be when it arrived. 

A servant came in to acquaint 
us with what its lumbering heavy 
noise up the paved inner court- 
yard apprised us of before. He 
spoke not. He could not speak. 
He looked, bowed and withdrew. 

I stept out. No one else could 
then stir. Her brother, however, 
soon followed me. When I came 
to the door, I beheld a sight very 
affecting. 

You have heard, sir, how uni- 
versally my dear cousin was be- 
loved. By the poor and middling 
sort especially, no young lady was 
ever so much beloved. And with 
reason: she was the common 
patroness of all the honest poor in 
her neighbourhood. 

It is natural for us, in every deep 
and sincere grief, to interest all 
we know in what is so concerning 
to ourselves. The servants of the 
family, it seems, had told their 
friends, and those theirs, that 
though, living, their dear young 
lady could not be received nor 
looKed upon, her body was per- 



Mitted to be brought home. The 

S ace of time was ao confined, that 
jBe who knew when she died, 
toiiat easily guess near the time the 
i&earBG was to come. A hearse, 

i through country villages, 
om London, however 
rfenderly attended, {for the cha- 
'fiot, BBlhave said, waited upon 
■ Mrs. Norton) takes every 
tine's attention. Nor was it hard 
to guess whose /^w must be, though 
not adorned by escutcheons, when 
ross roads to Harlowe Place 
■tiere taken, as soon as it came 
within six miles of it: so that the 
Learse, and the solemn tolling of 
flie bell, had drawn together at 
least fiftyoftheneighbouringmen, 
^meu, and children, and some of 
d appearance. Not a soul of 
Soem, it seems, with a dry eye, and 
sach lamenting the death of this 
Wmired lady, «*j, oslamtold, 
lecer >tirre<l out hit someboihj was 
ie better for her. 
^ These, whenthecoffinwastaken 
ont of the hearse, crowding about 
t, hindered for a few moments its 
Ming carriedin; theyouugpeople 
'Btruggling who should hear it ; and 
jret, with respectful tc/iisperrajs, 
Hftther than clamorous rvnlen 
L mark of veneration I had n 
lefore seen paid , upon any c 
ion, in all my travels, from the 
IBderbred many,from whom noise 
!l generally inaepiuableinall their 
mutations. 

At last six maidens were ] 
jutted to carry it in by the 
vandles. 

Thecorpse was thus borne, with 
" e most solemn leapect. into the 



347 

hall, and placed for the present . 
upon two stools there, TheplateB, 
and emblems, and inscription, set 
every one gazing upon it, and 
admiring it. The more, when they 
were told that all was of her own 
ordering. They wished to be per- 
mitted a sight of the corpse; but 
rather mentioned this as tneirwii/i 
than as their hope. When they 
had all satisfied their curiosity, 
and remarked upon the emblems, 
they dispersedwithbleBsingsupon 
her memory, and with tears and 
lamentations; pronouncing her to 
be happy; and inferring, were 
tr^enotso, what would become of 
them? While others ran overwith 
repetitions of the good she de- 
lighted to do, Nor were there 
wanting those among them, who 
heaped curses upon the man who 
was the author of her fall. 

The servants of the family then 
got about the coffin. They could 
not before: and that afforded a 
of sorrow: but a silent 



one; for they spoke only by their 
eves, and by sighs, looking upon 
the lid, and upon one another, by 
turns, with hands lifted up. The 
presence of their young master 
possibly might awe them, and 
cause their grief to be expressed 
only in dumb show. 

As for Mr. JftmesHarlowo, (who 
accompanied me, but withdrew 
when he saw the crowd] he stood 
looking upon the lid, when tho 
people had left it, with a fixed 
attention; yet, X daresay, knew 
not a symbol or letter upon it at 
that moment, had the question 
been asked him. In. u.^x:cAmxSL.

leverie be stood, bUarmE folded, 
his head on one aide, and marks of 
stupefaction imprinted up on every 
feature. 

But when the corpsewaacarried 
into the lesser parlour adjoining to 
itie hall, which she used to caJl her 
parlour, and put upon a table in 
ti)e middle of the room, and the 
father and mother,the two uncles, 
her aunt Hervej, and her sister, 
came in, joining her brother aud 
me,with trembling feet, and eager 
Toe, the scene was still more 
iffectiDg. Their aorrow was 
heightened, no doubt, bf the re- 
membrance of their unforgiving 
■everlty: and now seeing before 
them the receptacle that contained 
the gVoTj ot their family, who so 
late^ was driven thence by their 
indiscreet violence; never, never 
■nore to be reatoted to theml no 
wonder that their grief was more 
■"" an common grief. 

They would have withheld the 
jnother, it seems, from coming in; 
but when they could not, though 
■undetermined before, they all bore 
her company, led on by an impulse 
liiey could not resiat. The poor 
lady but just cast her <~ 
the coffin, and then sn 
ftway, retiring with passionate 
grief towards the window; yet 
addressing herself, with clasped 
ban da, aa if to her beloved 
daughter; my child, my child 1 
cried she; thou pride of my hope 1 
Why wasi not permitted to speak 
pardon and peace to thee! — 
forgive thy cruel mother! 

Her Bon (his heart then softened, 
as his eyes shewed) besought her 



to withdraw; and her woman 
looking in at that moment, be 
called her to assist him in coa- 
ducting her lady into the middle 
parlour: and then returning, met 
his father going out at the door, 
who also had but just cast his ej4 
on the cofHn, and yielded to my 
entreaties to withdraw. His grief 
was too deep for utterance, till be 
saw his son coming In; and then, 
fetching a heavy groan, Never, 
said he, was sorrow like my sorrow! 
— Oson! aonl — in a reproacliiDg 
accent, his face turned from tijm. 

I attended him through the 
middle parlour, endeavoiiring to 
console him. His lady wae theR 
Jes. She took his eye. B» 

motion towards her; Omy 

dear, said he — but turning- ehort, 
bis eyes as full as his heart, he 
hastened through to thegreat par- 
lour: and when there, he desired 
me to leave him to himself. 

The uncles andthe sister, looked 
sndtumed away, very often, upon 
the emblems, in silent aorrow. 
Mrs. Hervey would liave read to 
them the inscription — these wonia 
she did read , here the leicked cetue 
from troubling ^but could read no 
farther. Her teara fell in large 
drops upon the plate she was con- 
templating; and yet she was de- 
sirous of gratifying a curiosity that 
mingled impatience with her grief 
because she could nor gratify it, 
although she often wiped her eyes 
as they flowed. 

Judge you, Mr. Belf ord (for you 
have great humanity) how i must 
be a^cted. Yet was I forced to 
try to comfort them all. 



But here I will cloEe this letter, 
in order to send it to yon in the 
Tnoming early. Nevertheless, I 
will begin another, upon suppoei- 
tion that mj doleful prolixity will 
uot be disagreeable to you. lu- 
deed I am altogether indisposed 
for rest, as I mentioned before. So 
can do nothing but write. I have 
also more melancholy scenes to 
paint. Mypen, if I may bo say, is 
untired. These scenes are &esh 
upon my memory: and I myself, 
perhaps, may owe to you the 
favour of a review of them , with 
such other papers as you shall 
think proper t^ oblige me with, 
toften heacy grief has gieen wai/ lu 
milder melancholy. 

My servant, m his way to you 
with this letter, shalL call at St. 
Alban'a upon the good woman, 
that he may inform you how she 
does. Miss Arabella asked m« 
after her, when I withdrew to my 
chamber; to which she complai- 
santly accompanied me. She was 
much coacerued at the bad way 
we left her in \ and said her mother ' 
would be more so. i 

No wonder that the dear de- 1 
parted, who foresaw the remorse 
thatwould failto the lot of this un- 
happy family when they came to 
have the news of her death cod- 
frmed to them, was so grieved for 
their apprehended grief, and en- 
^eavovred to comfort ihem by lier 
posthumous letters. But it was still 
a greater generosity in her to trr 
to excuse tiiem t« me, as she dia, 
when we were alone together, a 
few hours before she died; and to, 
aggravate more than fas far as I 



349 

can find) she ought to have done, 
the only error she was ever guilty 
of. The more freely however 

ferhapa (exalted creature !) that 
mieht think the better of her 
li-ienas, although at her own ex- 
pense. 1 am, dear sir , 

Your faithful and obedient 
servant, 

Wm. Moedes. 



Wqbm the unhappy mourners 
wore all retired, I directed the lid 
of the coffin to he unscrewed, and 
caused some fresh aromatics and 
flowers to be put into it. 

The corpse was very little al- 
tered, notwithstanding the jour- 
ney. The sweet smile remained. 

The maids who brought the 
flowers were ambitious of strew- 
ing them aboutit: they poured 
forth fresh lamentations over her; 
each wishing she had been so 
happy as to hare been allowed to 
attend her in London. One of 
them particularly, who is, it 
seems, my cousin Arabella's per- 
sonal servant, was more clamorous 
in her grief than any of the rest ; 
and the moment she turned her 
back, all the others allowed she 
had reason for it. I inquired af- 
terwards about her , and found 
that this creature was set over my 
dear cousin, when she was con- 
fined to her chamber by indiscreet 
severity. 

Good Heaven ! that they should, 
treat, and Buffiii'c't\i'aa\a\i'i\.'W.^~^

a young lady, who was qualified 
to give TawB to all her family 1 

When my cousiu* were told, 
that the lid was unscrewed, they 
preased in again, all but the 
mouToful father and mother, as if 
by consent. Mrs. Hervey kissed 
her pale lips. Flower of the world! 
was all she could say; and gave 
place to Mias Arabella; who kiss- 
ing the forehead of lia- whom she 
had so cruelly treated could only 
say, to my cousin James (looking 
upon the corpse, and upon him) 
O, brother! — While he^ taking 
the fair lifeless hand, kissed it, 
and retreated with precipitation. 

Her two uncles were speechleos. 
They seemed to wait each other's 
example, whether to look upon 
the corpse or not I ordered the 
lid to be replaced ; and they then 
preased forward, as the othei 



;ain did, to take a last farewell fithi 



of the casket which so lately 
tainedsorich ajewel. 

Then it was that the grief of 
each found fluent expression ; and 
the fair corpse was addressed to, 
with all the tenderness that the 
•incerest love and warmest ad- 
liration could inspire, each ac- 
rding to their different degrees 



betokened lier being so! Tlietn- 
nehes tnoat unhappy !— And then, 
once more, the brother took the 
lifeless band, and vowed revengd 
upon it, on the cursed author of 
all this distress. 

The unhappy parents proposed 
to take one last view and farewell 
of their once darling daughter. 
The father was ^ot to the parlour 
door, after the inconsolable mo- 
ther: but neither of them were 
able to enter it. Tbemother said, 
she must once more see the child 
of her heart, or she should never 
enjoy herself. But they both 
agreed to refer their metanebobr 
curioeity till the next day; ud

and speechless both, their facea

He called out liia Bister, and she 
was of his opiition. So 1 left this 
upon them. 

They both, with no little 
warmth, hinted their disapproba-

cousin was obliged to your friend-

tiuns she laid you under, and your 
own inclination to observe tnem. 
J said, that you were a man of

, not willingly give oflcnce to any 
of them ; and that I was very fond 
of cultivating your favour and

declared, that he would write to

They were surjirised, that I bad 
given up to you the produce of 
her grandfather's estate, since his 
deatu. I told them plainly, that 
they must thank thcmselveB if 
any thing disagreeable to them 
occurred fi'om their sister's de-

They replied, they would re- 
port all 1 had said to their father 
aud mother; addiug, that great 
as their trouble was, they uund 
they had more still to come. But 
if Mr. Belford were to be the execn- 
tor of her will, contrary to their 
hopes, thoy besought me to take 
the trouble of transacting every 
thing with you; that a friend of 
the man to whom they owed all 
their calamity might not appear 
to them. 

They were extremely moved at 
the text their sister had chosen for 
the subject of the funeral dia- 
course.** I had extracted from 
the will that article, supposing it

probable, that I might not so aooii 
have an opportunity to shew them 
the will itself, as would otherwiae 
have been necesBary, on account 
of the interment; which cannot be 
delayed. 

Toe unhappy family are pre- 
paring for a mournful meeting at 
breakfast. Mr. Jamea Harlowe, 
who has had as little rest as I, haa 
written to Mr, MelviDe, who has 
promised to draw up a brief eulo- 
giun on the deceased. MisaHowc

see, for the last time, her beloved 
friend. 

MiBH Howe, by her messenger, 
desires she msy not be taken any 
notice of. Shs shall not tarry six 
minutea, was the word. Her desire 
will be easily granted her. 

Her servant, who brought the 
request, if it were denied, was to 
return, and meet her; for she was 
ready to set out in her chariot, 
when he got on horseback.

Slowly did the mournful cor ^ 
meet. Each lifelessly and spiriOl

I left them: and was just time 
enough to give MIbb Howe my 
hand as she alighted : her maid in I 
tears remaining in the chariot. 

I think you told me, sir, yoV 
never saw Miss Howe. She u * 
fine graceful young lady. A fixed 
melancholy on her whole aspecti 
overclouded a vivacity and fire, 
which, nevertheless, darted now-

Never did 1 tlunk, said ebe, ■ 
she gave me her hand, to ent'

dead, my Clarissa brings me tuter

She entered with me the littltt 
parlour; and seeing the ooffin^ 
withdrew her hand from mine| 
and with impatience pushed asidfl 
the lid. As impatiently she t» 
moved the face-olotb. In a wild 
air, she clasped her uplifted hand!

a little amended in her spirits: 
owing to the very posthumous let- 
ters, as I may call them, which 
you, Mr, Belford, as well as I, ap- 
prehended would have had fatal 
effects apon her. 

I cannot but attribute this to 
the right turn of her mind. It

[ Btaat hope of a Imtler life; and

The will is not to he looked into 
till the funeral rites are performed. 
Preparations are makmg for the 
solemnity; and the servants, as 
well as principals of all the 
branches of the family , are pnt 
into close mourning. 

I have seen Mr. Melville, He is 
a serious and sensible man. I 
have given him particulars to go 
upon in the discourse he is to pro- 
nounce at the funeral; but had the 
less need to do this, as I find he is 
eitremely well acquainted with 
' e whole unhappy stor^; and was 

personal admirer of my dear 

usin, and a sincere lamenter of 
her miafortunea and death. The 
reverend Dr. Lewen, who is but 
very lately dead, was his parti- 
cular friend, and had once intend- 
ed to reconunend himtoherfavouT 
and notice. 

1 AM just returned from attend- 
g the afflicted parents, in an

of their beloved child. They had 
requested my company, and that

clasped round her waist. The two 
mothers, as I may call them, of 
my beloved cousin, thus tenderly 
engagied! What a variety of dis- 
tress lu these woeful scenes ! 

The Unhappy father, in en- 
deavouring to comfort his lady,

— Touwould have prevailed upon

The greater my fault, said she, 

when I «new that displeasure was 

carried tno high, to acquiesce as 1

wasi, to let two angry children 

make me forget that I was mother

THE msTORV OP 



I 



have joiiied in these last honoura 
had they been able ; but the; weie ' 
both ver; much indispoBed ; and j' 
continue to be ao. I 

The inconsolable mother totd' 
Mra.NortOD, thatthe two mothers! 
of the sweetest child in the world ■ 
ought not, on this occftsion, to 
be separated. She therefore de- 1 
sired her to slay with her. ! 

The whole solemnity w&s per-j 
formed with great decency and I 
order. The distance from Har- 
lowe Place to the church is about 
hftlfamile. Ali thewaythe corpse 
was attended by great numbers of 
people of all conditions. 

It was nine when it entered the 
church; every corner of which 
was crowded. Such a profound, 
such a silent respect did I never 
see paid at the funeral of princes. 
An attentive sadness overspread 
the face of all. 

The eulogy pronounced by Mr. 
Melville was a very pathetic one. 
Hewiped his own eyes often, and 
made every body present still 
oftenerwipe theirs. 

The auditors were most parti- 
cularly affected, when he told 
them, that the solemn text was her 
own choice. 

He enumoraled her fine quali- 
ties, naming with honour their 
late worthy pastor for his autho- 

Every enumerated eiccellence 
was witnessed to in different parts 
of the church in respectful whis-j 
pers by different persons, as ofi 
their own knowledge, as I have 
been since informedT 

When he pointed to the pew| 



where {doing credit toreligio 
her example) she used to sit < 
kneel, the whole auditory, as or' 
person, turned to the pew wi 
the moat respectful aolemnity, I 
if she had been herself there. 

When the gentleman attribnti 
condeaccusion and mingled digi 
ty to her, a buzzing approbstu 
was given to the attribute throo^ 
out the church; and a poor nel 
woman under my pew addei 
" That she was indeed all ga 
id would speak i 



Umy eres ran over, when 1 
mentioned her charities, her wel 
judged charities. And her re 
was decreed from every n 
with sigha and sobs from e 
and thesewordsfromothers, ' 
poor will dearly miss her," 

The cheer fill gifcr whom God i 
said to love, was allowed to b 
her: and ayounglady, I am toM 
said, It was Miss Clarissa Ht 

lowe's care to find out the o 

happy, upon a sudden distress 
before the sighing heart waf 
whelmed by it. 

She had a set of poor peopt«| 
chosen for their remarkable how 
esty and ineffectual industrj;; 
These voluntarily paid tbeir laat 
attendance on their benefactren 
and mingling in the church U 
they could crowd near the usJi 
where the corpse was on b: 
it was the less wonder that htf 
praiaea from the preacher met 
with such general and such grata- 
ful whispers of approbation. 

Some it seems there were, wit9 
knowing her unhappy stofj', i~ 



CLARISSA BAfiLO^ 



marked upon the dejected looks 
of the brother, and the drowned 
eyes of the sister; "Owhatwould 
tney now give, they'd warrant, 
haa tbcy not been so hard-heart- 
ed!" — Others pursued , aalmay 
say, the severe father and unhappy 
mother, into their chambers at 
home — " Theyanswered for their 
relenting, now, that It was too 
late ! — What must be their grief! 
— No aonder they could not be 
present ! " 

Several eipresaedtheirastouish- 
ment, as people do every hour, 
"that a man could lire whom Guch 

Eerfectiona could not engage to 
e just to her;" to be Mnnane, I 
may say. — And who, her rank 
and fortuue considered, could be 
BO disregardful of his own iiileresl, 
had he had no other motive to be 
just? — 

The good divine, led by his 
teit, just touched upon the un- 
happy atep that was the cause of 
her untimely fate. He attributed 
it to the state of things below, in 
which there could not be absolute 
perfection. He veir politely 
touched upon the noble disdain 
she shewed (though earncBtly 
Bolicited hj a, whole splendid fa- 
mily) to jom interests with a man 
whom she found unworthy of her 
esteem and confidence: and who 
courted her with the utmost ear- 
nestness to accept of him. 

What he most insisted upon 
was, the happy end she made; 
&nd thence drew consolation to hor 
relations, and instruction to the 
auditory. 
In a word, his performance was 



359 

such as heightened the reputation 
which he bad before in a very 
eminent degree obtained, 

When the corpse was to be car- 
ried down into the vault (a very 
spacious one, within the church) 
there was great crowding to see 
the coffin lid, and the devices 
upon it. Particularly two gen- 
tiemen , muffled up in cloaks, 
pressed forward. These, it seems, 
were Mr. Mullins and Mr, Wyer- 
ley; both of them professed ad- 
mirers of my dear cousin. 

When they came neat the coffin, 
and cast their eyes upon the lid, 
"In that little space," aaid Mr. 
Mullins, "is included all human 
eicellencel" — And then Mr. 
Wyerley, unable to contain him- 
self, was forced to quit the church; 
and we hear is very ill. 

It is said that Mj*. Solmes was in 
a remote part of the church, 
wrapped round in a horseman's 
coat: and that he shed tears 
several timea. But I saw him 

Another gentleman was there 
incognito, m a pew near the en- 
trance of the vault, who bad not 
been taken notice of, but for his 
great emotion when he looked 
over hia jiew, at the time the coffin 
was earned down to its last place. 
This was Mies Howe's worthy Mr. 

My cousins John and Antony, 
and their nephew James, chose 
not to descend into the vault 
among their departed ancestors. 

Miss Harlowe was extremely 
afiected. Her conscience, as well 
asherlove, was concerned on the

loJnhaBulford, Esq. 



I HOPE , from the character my 
worthy cousin Morden gives you, 
that you will excuse the applica- 
tion I make to you, to oblige a 
whole family in au atfair that 
much concerns their peace, and 
cannot equally concern any body 
else, You will immediately judge, 
that this is ■' - ■ ^" 



of which my sister has given you 
the trouble by her last will. 

We shall all think ourselves 
eitremely obliged to you, if you 
please to relinquish this trust to 
our own family; the reasons which 
follow pleading for our expecta- 
tion of this favour from you: 

First, becaasc 3hciicvei:v!>^>i^ .

hare had the thought of trouhling 
jou, air, if she had believed any 
of her near relalioDs would have 
taken it upoa themBclres. 

Secondly, I understand, that 
she recommends to you in the 
will, to trnat to the honour of any 
of our family, for the performance 
of Bach of the articlea as are of a 
domestic nature. We are any of 
us, anda//of ua,if yourequest it, 
willing to stake our honours upon 
thia DCcaBion: and all you can de- 
aire, as a mau of honour, is, that 
the tmat be executed. 

We are the more concerned, 
air, to wish you to decline thia 
office, because of your short and 
accidental knowledge of the dear 
testatrix, and long and intimate 
acquaintance with tbe man to 
whom she owed her ruin, aud we 
tbe greatest loss and disappoint- 
ment (her manifold exceliencies 
considered) that ever befel 
family. 

You will allow due weight, 
dare say, to this plea, if you make 
our case your own : and so much 
the readier, when I aasure you, 
that your interfering in this 
matter ao much against our in- 
clinations (excuse, sir, my plain 
dealing) will very probably occa- 
aion an oppoaition in some points, 
where otherwise there might be 






What therefore I pro! 
not that my father should assume

to undertake it — nor yet myself

honour, and whose aff^ctjon tl 
the dear deceased , nobody 
doubted: and they will treat wilt 
you, air, through niy cousin Hm"

undertake to perform. 

The trouble you bare alnaU 
had, will well entitle yon to tM

IwENi back in this part of i 
coDversation to the day that 1 1 
obliged to come down to attend 
my lord, ia the dangerous illnesB 
which gome feared would have beer 
bis last. 

I told the colonel, "whateamest 
letterslbad written toaparticular 
friend, to engage him to prevail 
upon the lady not to slip a day 
that had been proposed for the 
private celebration of our nuptiala ; 
and of my letters* written to her- 
self on that subject;" for I had 
stepped to my closet, and fetched 
down all the letters and draughts, 
and copies of letters, relating to 
this affaur. 

I read to him "several passages 
in the copies of those letters, which 

" ieUcrs Ivli. ivlli. Bs. Uiil. of VuL UI. 



thou wilt remember make not a 
bttle to my honour." And I told 
him, "that 1 wished I bad kept 
copiesof those tomy friend on the 
lion; by which he would 
how much in earnest I 
professions to her, al- 
thoueh sfie would not answer oi 
of them." And thou njay'st n 
member, that ono of those fboT 
letters accounted to herself, wb/ 
1 was desirous she should remain, 
where I had left her.* 

I then proceeded to give him ta,' 
account "of the visit made hf, 
Lady Sarah and Lady Betty to 
LordM.andme.in order to indncs 
me to do her justice: ofmytead)^ 
ness to comply with their deures; 
and of their high opinion otha^

(though so much to my diiad- 
vantoce) which was written tO hsf 
by Misa Charlotte MontaguBi 
Ang. 1,** entreating her allianoH 
in the names of all our family. 

This made him ready tothinlw 
that his fair cousin carried iMT

did not imagiue, he said, that 
either myself or our family h 
been BO much in earnest.

will malte a bad cause a ^od one 
at any time. Wliat an aamixable

what a poor hand would this 
ehaimtog creature, with all her 
innocence, hare made of it in a 
twnrt of justice, against aman wlio 
had BO much to sng and to s/unn for 
himself I 

I then hinted at the generou! 
annual tender which Lord M. and 
his Biaters made to Lia fair cousin, 
ia apprehension that she might 
Buffer Dy her friends' implacaffie- 

And this also the colonel hiehly 
applauded, and was pleased to 
lament the unhappy misunder- 
standing between the two families, 
which had made the Uarlowes leas 
fond of an alliance with a family 
of 80 much honour, as this iustance 
shewed ours to be. 

I then told him, "that having, 
by my friend, [meaning thee] who 
was admitted into her presence, 
(and who had always been an 
admirer of her virtues, and had 
pvennte such advice from time to 
Ume in relation to her as 1 wished 
I had followed) been assured, that 
a visit from me would be very dis- 
agreeable to her, I once more 
resolved to try what a letterwould 
do; and that, accordingly, on the 
7th of August 1 wrote to her one. 

"This, colonel, is the copy of it. 
I was then out of humour with my 
lOrdlfT. and the ladies of myfa- 
Tou will therefore read it 
bjonradf."* 



203 

This letter gave him high aatis- 
faction. You write here , Mr, 
Lovelace, from your heart. 'Tisa 
letter full of penitence and ac- 
knowledsment. Your request is 
reasonable — to be forgiven only 
as you shall appear to deserve it 
after a time of probation, which 
you leave to her to fix. Pray, sir, 
did she return an answer to this 
letter? 

She did, but with I'e/MCfaitce, I 
own, and not tilll had declared by 
my friend, that if 1 could not pro- 
cure one, I would go up to town, 
and throw myself at her feet. 

1 wish 1 might be permitted to 
see it, sir, or to hear such parts 
of it read, as you ahall think 
proper. 

Turoiug over my papers, Here 
it is, sir.* I will make no scruple 
to put it into your hands. 

This is very obliging, Mr.Love- 

Hereadit. Mycharmingcousin!

Yet, how charitable herwishesl 
Good heaven! that such an ei-

shall tell you by-und-by, pro-

these two letters? I shall make

use of them to the advantage of 
you both. 

I told him, I would oblige him 
with all my heart And this he 
took very kindly (as he had rea- 
son) ; and put them in his pocket- 
book, promising to return them in 
a few days. 

I then told him, " that upon this 
her refusal, I took upon myself to 
go to town, in hopes to move her 
m my favour; and that, though I 
went without giving her notice of 
my intention, yet had she got some 
notion of my coming , and so con- 
trived to be out of the way : and 
at last, when she found I was fully 
determined at all events to see her, 
before I went abroad, (which I 
shall do, said I, if I cannot prevail 
upon her) she sent me the letter I 
have already mentioned to you, 
desiring me to suspend my pur> 
posed visit: and that for a reason 
which amazes and confounds me \ 
because I don*t find there is any 
thing in it: and yet I never knew 
her once dispense with her word ; 
for she always made it a maxim, 
that it was not lawful to do «i7, that 
good might come of it: and yet in 
this letter, for no reason in the 
world but to avoid seeing me, (to 
gratify an humour only) has she 
sent me out of town, depending 
upon the assurance she had given 
me. 

Col, This is indeed surprising. 
But I cannot believe that my 
cousin, for such an end only, or in> 
deed for any end, according to the 
character 1 hear of her, should 
stoop to make use of such an 
artince. 



Lovel, This, colonel, is the tiung 
that astonishes me; and yet, see 
here! — This is the letter she 
wrote me — nay , sir , 'tis her own 
hand. 

Col. I see it is; and a charming 
hand it is. 

LoveL You observe, colonel, 
that all her hopes of reconciliation 
with her parents are from yon. 
You are her dear blessed friend! 
She always talked of you with 
delight. 

Col. Would to heaven I had 
come to England before she left 
Harlowe Place ! — Nothing of this 
had then happened. Not a man 
of those whom I have heard that 
her friends proposed for her, 
should have had her. Nor yon, 
Mr. Lovelace , unless I had found 
you to be the man, every one who 
sees you must wish you to be: and if 
you had been that man, no one 
living should I have preferred to 
you for such an excellence. 

Mj lord and I both joined in the 
wish: and 'faith I wished it most 
cordially. 

The colonel read the letter twice 
over , and then returned it to me. 
'Tis all a mystery, said he. I can 
make nothing of it. For, alas ! her 
friends are as averse to a recon- 
ciliation as ever. 

Lord M. I could not have 
thought it. But don't you think 
there is something very favour- 
able to my nephew in this letter 
— something tnat looks as if the 
lady would comply at last? 

Col. Let me die if I know what 
to make of it. This letter is very 
different from her preceding one. 



ri- You returned an answer to it, 
Mr. Lovelace? 
Lnvel. An answer, colonel! No 
doubt of it. And an answer full 
of transport. 1 told her, "I would 
directly set out for LordM.'s, in 
obedience to Uer will. I told her 
that I would consent to an; tiling 
she should command , in order to 

r'omote this hapjiy reconciliation, 
told her, thiLt it should be my 
hourly study to the end of my life, 
to deserve a goodness so transcen- 
dent" But I cannot forbear Bay- 
ing, that I am not a little shocked 
andenrpriied, if nothingmorebe 
meant by it , than to get me into 

^tIle country without seeing her. 
Col. That can't be the thing, 
'«|epeaduponit,sir: there must be 
iboie in it thsii that. For were 
Aat all, she must think you would 
soon be undeceived , and that you 
woald then most probably resume 
your intention ~ unless , indeed, 
she depended upon seeing tiie in 
the interim, as she knew 1 wtis 
arrived. But I own, I know not 
what to make of it. Only that

But I shall know better how to^

James comes from Edinburgh; 
and he is every hour espected. 

But let me ask you, Mr. Love- 
lace, what is the name of your 
friend , who is admitted so easily 
into my cousin's presence? Is it 
not Belford, pray? 

Lovel. It is, air; Mr.Belford is 
amau of honour; andagreatad- 
mirer of your fair cousin. 

Was 1 right, as to the ;?<■,!/, Jack ? 
The laul 1 have such strong proof 
of, that it makes me questjon the 
^rst; since she would not have 
been out of the way of my intend- 
ed visit but for thee. 

Cot. Are you sure, air, that Mr. 
Belford is a man of honour? 

Liipcl. I can swear for him, 
colonel. What makes you put 
this question? 

Col. Only this; that anofficiouf 
pragmatical novice has been sent 
up to inquire into my cousin's life 
and conversation; and, would you 
believeitjthei'reQueutvisiUof this 
:entleman have oeen interpreted 



and you will be shocked at every 
part of it. 

This cursed letter, no doubt, is 
from the young Levite, whom 
thou. Jack, descrihedat, as making 
inquiry of Mrs. Smith about Miss 
Harlowe's character and visitors.* 

I believe I was a quarter of an 
hour in reading it: fori made it, 
though not a short one, six times' 
as long as it is, by the additions of 
oaths and curses to every pedantic 
line. Lord M. too helped to 
lengthen it, by the like ezecra- 



* aeev.S&i^Vwit 



tions. And thou, Jack, wilL have 
asmucLreason tocurseit as we. 

You cannnt but see, said the 
colonel, yiben 1 had done reading 
it, that thiBfellowhaabeen ii/yfci'ouj' 
in his malevolence; for what he 
saya ie mere hearaay, and that 
hearaay conjectural scandal, 
without fact, or the appearance 
of fact, to support it; bo tbatan 
nnprejudiced eye, upon the face 
of the letter, would condemn the 
writer of it , as I did , and acquit 
my cousin. But yet, such ia the 
Bpiritby which the rest of my rela- 
tions are governed , that they run 
away with the belief of the worst 
itinsinnates, and the dear creature 
has had shocking letters upon it; 
the pedant's hints are taken . and 
a voyage to one of the colonies 
has been proposed to her, as the 
only way to avoid Mr. Belford and 
you. I have not seen these letters, 
indeed; but they took a pride in 
repeating aome of their contents, 
which must have cut the poor aoul 
to the heart; and these, joined to 
her former sufferinga — what have 
you not, Mr. Lovelace, to answer 
for? 

Jju'el. Wbolhedevilconldhave 



there could be parents so impla- 
cable? Brother and sister so

body? — And what now can be

lus cousin. And by her last letter, 
it runs in my mind , that she bai 
some thoughts of forgiving all 
that's past. Do you thinK, colonel, 
if there should not be such a thing 
as a reconciliation going faiwara 
at present, that her letter may oot- 
imnl^, that if we t^'iu/fJ bring sQcli 
a Uiing to bear with her friends, 
she would be reconciled withMr. 
Lovelace? 

C'll. Such an artifice would 
better become the Italian aub- 
tility, than the English sii 
Your lordship has been it 
presume? 

Loeel. My lord has read Boc- 
.caccio, perhaps; and that's as 
well, aa to the hint he gives, which 
may be borrowed from one of that 
author's stories. But MisaCIfliTisrt 
Harlowe is above all artifice. Shs 
must have some meaning I a 
fathom. 

Col. Well, my lord, I can only 
say, that I will make soineuseof 
the letters Mr. LoreJace baa ob- 
liged me with: and after 1 b 
had some talk with my oouria 
James, who is hourly expected) 
and when 1 have dispatched two 
or three affairs that press upon 
me; 1 will pay myrespecta toBiy 
dear cousin; and shall then H 
able to form a bet 
things. Me3ntim< 
her; for 1 have a 
about her, and find she wanU 
consolation. 

Ltivel- If you favour me, co- 
lonel, with the d— n'd letter of 
that fellow Brand, for a day o 
two, you will oblige me. 

Col. Iwill, but remember, itj 



^najt isaparson, Mr.Lovelace; an 
iBaocent one too they eaj. Else 
1 had been at him before now. 
AAd these college novices^ who 
think thej know everj thing in 
their cloisters , and that all learn- 
ing lies in bouts, make dismal 
figureB when they come into the 
world among inen and icnrnen. 

Lord M. Brand! Bniiid! It 
should have been Firebraml , I 
tbiiikf inmy conscience! 

Thua ended thia doughty con- 
ference. 

1 cannot say, Jack, hut I am 
greatly taken with Col. Morden. 
He is bravo and gecerona, and 
knowB the world; and then biB 
contempt of the jiaraonn ia a 
t&in Eign that he is one of us. 

We parted with great civi 
Liord U. (not a little pleased that 
wo did, and as greatly taken with 
the colonel) repeated his wish, 
after the colonel was gone, that 
he had arrived in time to save the 
lady; if that would have done it. 

I wish so too. For, by my aonl, 
Jack, I am every day more and 
more uneaay about her. Butlhope 
she is not BO ill as I am told she is. 

IhavemadeCharlotte transcribe 
the letter of thia Firehranil, as my 
lord calls him; and will inclose 
her copy of it. All thy phlegm 1

ance when thou rcadest it, 

I know not what to adi'ise as

and for their proposal to her of

One word more, as to a matter of 
erudiliun, which yougreatlylove

Dr. Lewen once, in your pre- 
sence, (as yon, my good patrnti, 
eanuot but remember) in a, 
siurtrliii kind of debate be- 
tween hint and me, took upon 
him to censure thejiarmlhetical 
style, as I call it. He was a very 
learned and judicious man, to 
be sure, and an ornament to niir 
functitin: but yet I must needs 
say, that it is a style which 1 
greatly lilte ; and the good doc- 
tor was then past his yiuth, and 
that time of life, of consequence, 
when a fertile {maifmatiim, and 
i-ich faniy, pour in ideas ao fast 
Qpon a writer, that parentheses 
are often wanted (and that for 
the salie of hrecity, as well as 
perspicuity) to save the reader 
the trouble of reading apassage 
more than iiace. Every man to

are all so apt to set up our

I sent down for Mrs. Lovicfc, and

acquaint the lady (who was busied 
in ber closet) that I had letters 
from Berks; in which 1 was in- 
formed that the interview between 
Col. Morden and Mr. Lovelace had 
ended without ill consequences^ 
that the colonel intended to write 
to her very soon, and was bterest- 
ing himself meanwhile in her fa- 
vour, with her relations: that I 
hoped, that this agreeable news 
would be the means of giving her 
good rest; and I would wait upon 
her in the morning, by the time 
she should return from prayers, 
with all the particulars. 

She sent me word, that ahe

has taken great liberties with my 
character, and with that of the 
most unblameable lady in T

formationa that you, madam, have 
given him. And then I read to 
tbem several passages in bin

she bad for giving that fellow 
such impressions of either of ns? 

They knew not what te answer:

lady had run away irora her 
parents; what worthy and rich 
people they were ; in what favour 
he stood with them; and that they

distinguish the iroth and nrhipt- 
Byllabub in them , from the cream, 
in what one could and rrmld nni 
readtoa womanof eofineamind; 
since four pnrts out of six of thj 
letters, which I thought enter-

appeared to me, when I would 
have read them to her, most ab- 
ominable atuif, and gave mea very 
contemptible idea of thy talents, 
and of my own judgment. 

She was far from rejoicing, ae 
I had done, at the disappointment 
her letter gave you when 
plained. 

She said, nhe meant only ai 
nocent allegory, which might 
carry instruction and warning to 
you, when the meaning was taken, 
a,e well as answer her own bopcf 
for the time. It was run off in « 
hurry. She was afraid it was not 
quite right in her. But hoped the 
end would excuse [if it could not 
justify) the means. And then she 
again expressed a good deal of 
apprehension, lest you should still 
t^e it into your head to molest 
her, when her time, she said, was 
BO short, that she wanted every 
moment of it; repeating what she 
bad said once before, that when 
she wrote, she was so ill, that she 
believed she should not have lived 
till now. If she had thought she 
should, she must have studied for 
an expedient that would have 
better answered her intentions.

knowledge of ua both.

Nor think me , my dear cousin,

eiven Mr. Lovelace no reason to 
think me a weak creature. If I 
Imd, aman of his character might 
have thought himself warranted 
to endeavour to take ungeneroue 
advantage of the weakness he 
had been able to inspire. The 
consciousness ofmgoipii weakness 
(in that case) might have brought

that is, because 1 think his crimes

'Tie evident, that she sat down 
to write this letter with a design 
to mialead and deceive. And if 
she be capable of that, at such a

It is surprising that I, a miin,

was, at such an object as was the 
subject of my former letter; who

piece with thy generosity to thy 
Rosebud and her Johnny ; and to 
a number of other good actions, 
in pecuniary matters: although 
thy Rosebud's is, I believe, the 
only instance, where a pretty' 
woman was concerned, of such a 
disinterested bounty. 

Upon my faith, Lovelace, I love 
topraisethee; and often and often, 
as thou knowest, have I studied for 
occasions to do it : insomuch, that 
when for the life of me I could not 
think of any thing done by thee 
that deserved praise, I have taken 
pains to applaud the not ungrace- 
ful manner in which thou hast 
performed actions that merited 
the gallows. 

Now thou art so near, I will 
dispatch my servant to thee if 
occasion recjuires. But, I fear, I 
shall soon give thee the news thou 
apprehendest. For I am just now 
sent for by Mrs. Smith; who has 
ordered the messenger to tell me, 
that she knew not if the lady will 
be alive when I come. 

Friday, Sept. 1. Two o'clock at Smith's. 

I COULD not close my letter in 
such an uncertainty as must have 
added to your impatience. For 
you have, on several occasions, 
convinced me , that the suspense 
you love to give, would be the 
greatest torment to you that you 
could receive. A common case with 
all aggressive and violent spirits, 
I believe. I will just mention then 
(your servant waiting here till I 
nave written) that the lady has 
had two very severe fits: in the 
last of which whilst she lay, they 



sent to the doctor and Mr. God- 
dard , who both advised that a 
messenger should be dispatched 
for me, as her executor; bebg 
doubtful whether, if she had a 
third, it would not carry her off. 

She was tolerably recovered by 
the time I came; and the doctor 
made her promise before me, that, 
while she was so weak, she would 
not attempt any more to go 
abroad; for, by Mrs. Lovick's 
description who attended her, the 
shortness of her breath, her ex- 
treme weakness , and the fervour 
of her devotions when at church, 
were contraries, which, pulling 
different ways, (the soul aspiring, 
the body sinking) tore her tender 
frame in pieces. 

So much for the present. I shall 
detain Will no longer than just to 
beg , that you will send me back 
this packet, and the last. Your 
memory is so good, that once 
reading is all you ever give, or 
need to give, to any thing. And 
who but ourselves can make oirf 
our characters, were you inclined 
to let any body see what passes 
between us? Ifl cannot be obliged, 
I shall be tempted to with-nold 
what I write till 1 have time to take 
a copy of it. * 

A letter from Miss Howe is just 
now brought by a particular mes- 
senger, who says he must carry

when thej are to do good, tiiev 
are to require joor consent. 

How me dear creature's char- 
acter rises in erery line of tfaj 
letters! but it is owing to the on- 
common occasions she has met 
with that she blazes ont npon as 
with soch a meridian lostrer How, 
but for those occasions, could her 
noble sentiments, her prudent 
consideration, her forgiving spirit, 
her exalted benevolence, and her 
equanimity in view of the most 
shocking prospects, 'which set her 
in a light so superior to ail her sex, 
and even to the philosophers of 
antiquity) have been manifested? 

I EDOW thou wilt think I am 
going to claim some merit to 
mysdf, for having given her such 
opportunities of signalizing her 
virtues. But I am not; for, if I did, 
I must share that merit with her 
implacable relations, who would 
justly be entitled to two-ildrds of 
it, at least : and my soul disdains 
a partnership in any thing with 
such a family. 

But this I mention as an answer 
to thy reproaches that I could be 
so little edified by the perfections, 
to which thou supposest, I was for 
so long together daily and hourly 
a personal witoess — when admir- 
able as she was in all she said, and 
in all she did, occasion had not at 
that time ripened, and called forth 
those amazmg perfections which 
now astonish ana confound me. 

Hence it is , that I admire her 
more than ever; and that my love 
for her is less personal^ as I may 
gay, more intellectual, than ever I 
thought it could be to woman. 



Hence als^ :t is, thak I am eon- 
fident would it please the Fates 
to spare her, and make her mine) 
I could love her with a purity thtt 
would draw on auf omm Fcnras, ts 
well as ensure Ker TaaomAL hap- 
piness. — And henee, bjneeessaiy 
consequence, shall 1 be the most 
miserable of all men, if 1 am de- 
prived of her. 

Thou severely reflectest iqMm 
me for my levity; the Abbey in- 
stance in thine eye, I suppose. 
And I will be ingenuous enongh 
to own, that as thou seestnotmy 
heart , there may be passages, in 
every one of my letters, which (the 
; melancholy occasion considered) 
I deserve thy most pointed rebukes. 
i But, faith. Jack, thou art such a 
tragi -comical mortal, with thy 
leaden aspirations at one time, 
and thy flying hour-glasses and 
i dreaming terrors at another, that, 
as Prior says. What serious iSj thu 
turri'st to farce; and it is impos- 
sible to keep within the bounds 
of decorum or gravity, when one 
reads what thou writest. 

But to restrain myself, (for mj 
constitutional gaiety was ready to 
run away with me again) I will 
repeat, I must ever repeat, that 
I am most egregiously affected 
with the circumstances of the 
case: and, were this paragon 
actually to quit the world!, should 
never enjoy myself one hour to- 
gether, though I were to live to 
the age of Methusalem.

that my lemty is owing: for 1

Sat motnlag, Stpl, 
I HAVE some little pleasure given 
me by thine, just now brought me.

The lady ia alive, and serene, 
and calm, and baa all her noble 
intellects clear and strong: but 
nineteen will not however save her. 
She says, she will ni^w content her- 
self with her closet duties, and the 
visits of the parish minister; 
will not attempt to go out. Nor, 
indeed, will she, I am afraid, ever 
walk up or down a pair of Etairs 



I a 



JOrry at my soul to have 
ly : but it would be a folly 



this to say 
to flatter thee. 

Aa to thy seeing her, I believe 
the least hint of that sort, now, 
would cut off some houra of her 
life. 

What baa contributed 
serenity, it seems, ia that taking 
the alarm her fits gave her, she 
has entirely finisbed, and signed 
and sealed, her last will: which 
she had deferred doing till tbis; 
time, in hopes, as she said, of some i 



good news from Harlowe Place, 
nhich would have induced her [o 
alter some passages in it. 

KIJEsHowe's letter wasnot given 
her till foor in the aftemoon, 
yesterday; at which time the 
messenger returned fbrananswer. 
She admitted faim into her pre- 
sence in the dining- room, ill asshe 
then was, and she would have 
written a few lines, aadeairedby 
Miss Howe; but not being able to 
hold a pen, ahe bid themeBaenget 
tell her, that she hoped to be w«ll 
enough to write a long letter bj 
ueit day's post; and wonla 
□o<v detain him. 



CALLED just now, and foiml, 
the lady writing to Miss Hoha 
She made me a melancholy con- 
>liment, that she shewed me not 
liss Howe's letter, because I 
hould soon have that and all bet 
papers before me. But she toU 
me, that Miss Ho we bad very oo*' 
siderately obviated to Coloid 
Morden several things which 
might have occasioned misappl*- 
benstons between him and m»\ 
and had likewise put aligbter con- 
struction, for the aake ofpeace,ei 
some of your actions, taaa tb«r 
deserved. 

She added, that her counn 
Morden was warmly engaged in 
her favour with her friends; and 
one good piece of neirs Hio 
Howes letter contained; that bet

froj^era, I shall again be happy. 
write with still the more alacrity, 
aa I have an opportunity pivenme 
to tODch upon a subject in which 
yoa are nearly concerned. 

You must know then, my dear, 
that your cousin Morden has been 
here with me. He told me of an 
interview he had on Monday at < 
Lord M.'s with Lovelace; and 
asked me abundance of qnestiooB 
about you , and about that 
viilainoua man. 

I could have raised a fine flame 
between them if I would: but, 
observing that he is a man of very 
livelv passiona, and believing you 
would be miserable if any thiug 
should happen to him from a 
quarrel with a man who is known 
to have so many advantages athis 
aword, I made not the worst of the 
subjects we talked of. Bi 
could not tell untruths 
favour, you must think I said 
enough to make him curse the 
wretcli. 

I don't find, well as they used to 
respect Colonel Morden, that he 
has influence enough upon them 
to bring them to any terms of re- 
conciliation. 

What can they mean by it? — 
But your brother ia come home, it 
seems; so, the honour of the house, 
the reputation of the family, is all 
the cry 1 

The colonel ia exceedingly out 
of humour with them all. Yet has 
he not hitherto, it seems, i 
jfoar bmtal hrolhei. I told 



how ill yon were, i 
cated to him eome of the content! 
of your letter. He admired yau, 
cursed Xdcefarc. and raved against 

all your family, — He declared, 
that they were all unworthy <» 
yon. 

At his earnest request, 1 per- 
mitted him to take some brirf 
notes of such of the contents ofi 
your letter to rae, as I thought I 
cimlil read to him; and, particu- 
larly, of your melancholy 
elusion.* 

Me says, that none of yoni 
friends think yon so ill as yoa AM| 
nor will believe it. He is mii 
they all love you, and that dea^ 

If they do , their present Iwrd-

The colonel (as one of your

and, iu the meantime, he ha 
actually engaged them to reinit ti

lour cousin imagines, that, 

^Tre a reconciliation takes pi ace, 
r will ineiat, that you shall 
:esiich a will, as to that estate, 
a they ahall approve of; but he 
declares, he will not go out of 
England till he has seen justice 
done you by eaery l/ody; and that 



yon shall not be imposed on either 
by friend or foe — 

IJy relation or foe, should he not 
have said ? — For a friend will not 
impoae upon a friend. 

So, my dear, you are trf Any ji'cr 
peace, if some people are to have 
their wills! 

Your cousin [not /, my dear, 
though it was always myopinion"] 
aays, that the whole family ia Ion 
rir/i, to he either himhU, ron- 
«iilerale, or cin/nitaf. And as for 
himaelf , he has an ample fortune, 
he snys, and thinks of leaving it 
wholly to j-ou. 

Had this Tiliain Lovelace con- 
sulted his worldly interest atily, 
what a fortune would he have had 
in yon, even although your marry- 
ing him had lieprived you of a 
paternal share ! 

I am obliged to leave off here. 
But having a good deal still to 
write, ana my mother better, I 
will pursue the subject in another 
letter, although I send both to- 

f ether. 1 need not say how much 
am, and will ever be, 

Your affectionate, &c.

The colonel thought fit once, in 
praise of Lofelace'a^enern^fy, to

he took to himself all the blame,

that there wae no need of any

come out, ua indeed one of the 
letters you had written to your 
friends, and which bad been shewn

is to flay, my dear, it any thing 
worse than perjury, broach of 
faith, and abuse of a generous 
confidence, were to appearl — 

Iaorry fellowsl] he would avenge 
lis cousin to the utmost. 

I urged your apprehensiona on 
thia head from your last letter to 
me: but he seemed capable of 
taking what I kuow to be real 
greatness of Goul, in an unworthy 
sense: for he meutioned directly 
upon it, the eipectatiou your 
friends had, that you should (pre- 
vious to any reconciliation with 
them) appear in a court of justice 
against the villain — If you could 
do it with the advantage to your- 
self that I hiuted might be done. 

And truly.ifl would havebeard 
him, he had indelicacy euougli to 



have gone into the nature of the 
proof of the crime upon which thsj 
wanted to have Lovelace a^ 
raigned. Yet thia is a man im- 

B roved by travel and learning! —

have been accustomed t« the moM 
delicate conversation ever nncefl 
had the honour to know yon, (JM 
apiae this sei from the gentlemllF 
down to the peasant. 

Upon the whole , I find that Ht, 
Morden has avery slender notim 
of women's virtue, iu particalO' 
cases: for which reason I pot bin 
down, though yourfavourite, at 
one who is not entitled tn cant (1* 
fivKtsUme. 

I never knew a man who de- 
served to be well thougbt of hin- 
self for his morals, who biid I 
alight opinion of the virtue rf 
our ses in general. For if, ftolft 
the difference of leniperamait Iiii 
eiJucaiiitn, modesty, chastity, md 
piety too, are not to be fotmdJI 
our aex preferable to the other, I 
should tnink it a sign of AintN 
worse nature in ours.

I vroKCEs not at the impatience 
your servant tells me you express 
to bcur from me. I was designiuf 
to write you a loDg tetter, am 
was just returned from Smith' 
for tbat purpose; bat since yoi 
are BO urgent, you must be con 
tented with a short one. 

J attended the lady thie morn 
iug, just before I set out for 
Kdgeware. She was bo ill over 
night, that she was obliged t( 
leave unfinished her letter to Mis 
Howe, But early this mominf 
she made an end of it, and bai 
just sealed it up as I came. Shi 
was so fatigued with writing, tbat 
she told me she would lie down 
after I waa gone, and endeavour 
to recruit her apirits. 

They bad sent for Mr. Goddard, 
when she was so ill last night; 
and Hot being able to see nim 
out of her own chamber, he, for 
the first time, saw her house as 
she calls it. He was extremely 
shocked and concerned at it; and 
chid Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick 
for not persuading her to have 
such an object removed from ' 
bed-chombei': and when they 



cused themselves on the lillU 
itharity it was reasonable to suu- 
poae they must have with a lady 
so much their superior, here- 
fleeted warmly ou those whohad 
re authority, and who lefther 
proceed with such a shock- 
; and solemn whimsy , as be 
lied it. 

It is placed near the windo*. 
like a harpsichord, thoiieh covered 
to the ground: and wbenshe

to her closet, she writes and reads 
upon it, SB othera would uponi 
desk or table. But (only aa ahe 
ill last night) she cfaooau 
tee any body in that apart 

I went to Edgewttre; aud, re- 
turning in the evening, attended 
her again. She bad a letter 
brought her from Mrs. Norton (a 
long one, as itseemsby ilsbnlk'i 
just before I came. But sbehni) 
not opened it; and said, thatw 
she was pretty calm and com- 
posed, ahewas afraid to loolcinli) 
the contents, lest she should be 
ruflled; expecting, now, to liev 
of nothbg that could do her good 
or give her pleasure firom thtl 
good woman's dear hard-hear^ti 
neighbours., as she called het own 
relations. 

Seeing her so weak and ill. ' 
withdrew, nor did she desire »>''

her pleasure and spirits; and 
being a necessary preparation,

that he beheved she wonld hold

friends to have notice of her state, 
and to see her, and hardW longer; 
and since he could not find, that 
she bad any certainty of aeeing

it plain that her relations con-

to do every thing in the justest

putting myself in my relations

ordering my matters, as if no mis-

I hope they mil not think much

and where due from my gratitude: 
but if they should, what is done, 
iadone; and I cannot now help it. 
Yet I must repeat, that I hope, I 
hope, 1 have pleased every oue of 
them. For I would not, on any 
account, have it thought, that, 
in my last disposition , anything 




. should have had place 
in a mind that is so truly A'ee (as I 
will presume to say) from all re-

with gratitude and blessings for

My cousin, you tell me, thinks 
was off my guard, and that I was 
taken at some disadvantage. In- 
deed, my dear, I was not. Indeed 
I gave no room for advantage to 
he taken of me. 1 hope, one day, 
that will be seen, it I have the 
justice done me which Mr. Belford 

I should hope, that my cousin 
hasnottaken the liberties, which 
you, (by an observation nut, in. 
geueral, unjnet) seem to charge 
him with. For it is sad to think, 
that the generality of that sex 
should make so light of crimes, 
which they justly hold so unpar- 
donable in their own most in- 
timate relations of ours — yet 
cannot conimitthem without doing 
such injuries to other families aa 
they thiuk themselves obliged to

Bsnecalledit, hia eolicitations m

jaar penitence; your ill health; 
your virtue, though once betrayed, 
and basely used ; he then read to 
them Mr. Lovelace's letter, a most 
contrite one indeed*; and your 
ir^ft-sDu/eii answer**; for that was 
what he justly called it; and he 
treated as it deserved Mr. Brand's 
officious information (of which, 1 
had before heard, he had made 
them ashamed) by representations 
fonnded upon inquiries made by 
Mr. Alston***, whom he had pro-

quaint himself with your manner 
oflife, and what was meant by the

farewell of Miss Howe : Adieu , my 
dear, adi'm," are you words — 

0, my child! my childl said 
your mamma, weeping, and clasp- 
■-ig her hands. 

Dearmadam, said your brother, 
e so good as to think you have 
lore children than this ungrateful 

Yet your siater seemed af- 

Your uncle Harlowe, wiping 
bis eyes, O cousin, said he, if one 
thonghtthe poor girl was really so 



ill 

She mmt, said your uncle An- 
tony. This is written to her pri- 
vate friend. God forbid she should 
be quite lostl 

Your uncle Harlowe wished they 
did not carry their resentments 

I begged, for Kod's sake, wring- 
ing my hands, and with a bonded 
knee, that they would permit me 
to go up to you; eugagmg to give 
them a faithful account of the way 

{ou were in. But I was chidden 
y your brother; and this occa- 
sioned some angry words between 
him and Mr. Morden. 

I beheve , sir, I believe, madam, 
said your sister , to her father and 
mother, we need not trouble my 
cousin to read any more. It does 
but grieve and disturb you. My 
sister Clary seems to be ill: I think, 
if Mrs. Norton were permitted to 
go up to her, it would be right. 
Wickedly as she has acted, ifshe 
be truly penitent — 

Here she stopt; and every one 
being silent, 1 stood up once more, 
aud besought them to let lue govj 



24G 

and then i offered to read a pas- 
sage or two in your letter to me of 
the 24th. Butlwastakeu up again 
by your brother; and this occa- 
sioned still hicber words bctneen 
the colonel and him. 

Your mother, hoping to gain 
upon your infleiible brother , and 
to divert the anger of the two 
gentlemen from each other, pro- 
poHcd that the colonel should pro- 
ceed in reading the minutes he 
had taken from yout letter. 

He accordingly read, "Of your 
resuming your pen; that you 
thought you bad taken your last 
farewell; and tlie reet of that very 
affecting passage, in which you 
are obliged to break off more than 
once and afterwards to take an 
airing in a chair." Your brother 
and sister were affected at this; 
and he had recourse to his saxiS- 
box. And where you comfort Miss 
Howe, and aay, "You shall be 
happy;" Itifi more, said he, than 
Bbe will let any body elae be. 

Your sister called you, aweet 
eoul! but with a low voice: then 



affected by your pathetic grief 
but that it was your talent. 

The colonel then went on to the 
good effect your airing had upon 
you; to your good wiBhea to Miaa 
Howe and Mr. Hickman; aud to 
your concluding sentence, that 
when the happy life you wished to 
her cornea to be wound up, she 
may be as calm aud as easy at 
quitting it, as you hope in G ' 
you shall be. Your mother co 
aot stand this; but lettred ti

comer of the room, and sobbed, 
and wept. Your father for a few 
minutes could not speak, though 
he seemed inclined to say aoine' 

Your uncles were also both af' 
fected ; — but your brother went 
round to each; and again reminded, 
yoiu' mother that she had olbw 
children: what was there, he said, 
ID what was read, but the result 
of the talent you had of movhij 
the passions? and he blamed them 
for choosing to hear read what 
they knew their abused induIgenoK

Jour part in her education, aa to 
er fttmily, ia a weakness that 
would induce one to suspect your 
virtue if you were to be encount-

By some such charitable logic,

I li^oubt not. If to be uncharitable

"f virtue, you, Mr. James Har-

I J knew how it would be , replied 
■our brother, in a passion . if I 
t Mr. Morden upon this busi- 
nesa. X would liave declined it: 
but you, sir, to his father, would 
not permit me so to do. 

But, sir, turning to the colo- 
,0 other presence —

fiances thus 
sir, — and the son and nephew of 
persona as dear as near to me —

Arene, said your father, to be 
mode still more unhappy among 
ouraelrea, when the villain lives 
Ibatonght to be the object of every 
one's roaentmeut, who has either 
a value for the family, or for this 
luurratefnl girl? 

That's the man , said your cou- 
sin, whom last Monday, as you 
know. I went purposely to make 
the object of mine. But what could 
I aS7i when I found bim so willing 



247 

to repair his crime? — And I give 
itasmy opinion, and have written 
accorduigly tomypoorcousin,that 
it is best for all round, that his 
oSer should be accepted^ and let 
me tell you — 

Tell me nothing, said your fa- 
ther, quite enraged, of tbatvery 
vile fellow I I have a riveted 
hatred to him. I would rather see 
the rebel die an hundred deaths, 
were it poesible, than that she 
should give such a villain as him 
a relation to my family. 

Well, but there is no room to 
think, said your mother, that she 



it. If she be BO ill as 
wears told sheis, let us send Mrs. 
Norton up to her. — That's the 
ieasi we can do — let us take her, 
however, out of the hands of that 
Belford. 

Both your uncles supported this 
motion ; the latter part of it espe- 

Your brother observed, in his 
ill-natured way, what a fine piece 
of consiateucy it was, in you, to 
refuse the vile injurer, and the 
amends he offered; yet to throw 
yourself upon the protection of his 

Miss Harlowe was apprehen-

to approve of it. But your brother 
dashed all. I hope, sir, said he, 
to bis father; I hope, madam, to 
his mother; that you irill not 
endeavour to recover a faulti 



ever my sister Clary darkens thes^ 
doors again, I never will. I will 
set out, madam, the same hour 
you go to London (on such an er- 
rand) to Edinburgh; and there 
I will reside; and try to forget 
that I have relations in England 
so near and so dear as you arenow 
all to me. 

Good God, said the colonel, 
what a declaration is this ! — And 
BUppoHe, sir, and suppose, ma- 
dam, [turning to your father and 
mother] this slimild be the case, 
whether is it better, think you, 
that you should loae for ever such 
a daughter aa my cousin Clarv, or 
that your sou should go to Ediu- 
hurgh, and reside there upon an 
estate which will be the better for 
for hia residence upon it. 

Youi' brother's passionate be- 
haviour hereupon is hardly to be 
described, ile reaented it aa pro- 
moting an alienation of the aaec-', 
tian oftbe family to him. Avdto' 



such a height wei'e resentments 
carried, every one siding with 
him, that the colouel, with hands 
and eyes lifted up, cried ont, what 
hearts of Sint am 1 related to! —

ther,^ are youreaolved to have' '^

CO bowels, to forget yon are a

The colonel turned from . 
to draw out his handkerchief, and 
could not for a minute spealb Tbe 
eyea of every one but the hard- 
hearted brother, caught tosM 
from his. 

But then turning to them (with 
the more indignation, asitseemsd, 
as he had been obliged to ibews 
humanity, which, bowever, M 
bravo heart should be asbaiiHJ 
of) I leave ye all, said he, fit 
company for one another. Iwill 
never open my lips to any of you

with me ; nor shall she return till 
ye know the value of sach

And saying this, he burned 
of the room, went into the oOOit- 
yard, and ordered his horse. 

Mr. Antony Hariowe went

of US one word to the other. At 
last she broke HJIence, asking me, 
if you were really and indeed bo 
illasit wasiaid you were? 

I answered in the affirmative; 
and would have shewn her your 
laat letter; but she declined Boe- 
ing it. 

Iwould fain have procured from 
her the favour of a line to yon, 
with her hleaaing. 1 asked, what 
was intended by your brother and 
sister? would nothine satisfy them 
but your final reprobation? — I 
insinuated, how easy it would be, 
did not your duty and humility 

fovem you, to make yourself in- 
ependent as to circumstances; 
but that nothing but a blessing, a 
last blesaing, was re quests Q by 
you. And many other things I 
urged in your behalf. The fol- 
lowing brief repetition of what she 
was pleased to say in answer to 
TQJ pleas, will give you a notion 
of it all; and of the present aitua- 
tionof tbings. 

She said, "She was very un- 
happy! — She had lost the little 
authority she once had over her 
other children, through one child's 
failing; and all iuSuence over Mr. 
Harlowe and bis brothers. Your 
father, she said, had besought her 
to leave it to hhn to take his own 
methods with you: and (as she 
valued him) to take no step in 
your favour nnknown to him and 
your uncles: yet she owned, that 
they were too much governed by 
your brother. They would, how- 
ever, give way in time, she know, 
toazeeoadliaitio^i: theydeaigaed| 



) other ; for they all still loved 



you. 

"Your brother and sister, she 
owned, were very jealousof your 
coming into favour aeain: yet 
could but Mr. Morden have kept 
his temper, and stood her son's 
first sallies, who (having alwayi 
had the family grandeur in view) 
had carried bis resentment h 
high, that be knew not how to 
descend, the conferences, so ab- 
ruptly broken off just now, wonid 
have endedmoTO happily; for tlut 
she had reason to think, that a 
few concessions on your part, 
with regard to your grandfatlier'i 

gaging for your submission 
from pro/ier motives, would bars 
softened them all. 

"Mr. Brand's account of your 
intimacy with the friend of the 
obnoxious man, she said, had, Sit 
very unhappy effectsr 
for before that she had gainea 
ground ; but afterwardi 
dared not, nor indeed had inclina- 
tion, to open her lips in youi be- 
half. Your continued intimaey 
with that Mr. Belford was wholly 
unaccountable, and as wholly ii 
excusable. 

"What made the wished-fbi 
reconciliation, she said, more dif- 
ficult, was, first, that you yooi- 
self acknowledged yourself «^ 
honoured (and it was too wdl 
known, that it was ^our own fault 
that you ever were m thi 
BO great a profligate) ;

pardon &nd bleaaing hoped for, 
mnst probably be Btteuiftd with 
TOnr marriage to the man they 
hate, and who hates them as 
much: very dia agreeable circum- 
stances, she said, I must allow, to 
found a reconciliation upon. 

"As to her own part, she must 
needs say, thatifthere were ajiy 
hope that Mr. Lovelace would 
become a, reformed man, the letter 
her cousin Morden had read to 
them from him to you, and the 
justice (as she hoped it was) he 
did your chamcter, though to his 
own condemnation (Mb family 
and fortunes being unexception- 
able) and all his relatioua earnent 
to be related to you, were argu- 
ments that would have weight 
with her, could they have any 
with your father and uncles." 

To my plea of your illness. 
" She could not but flatter herself, 
she answered, that it was from 
lowness of spirits, and temporary 
d^ection. A young creature, she

naturally were, and fallen so low,

"^ey lose you, which God forbid! 
Bcene would then indeed be

brance, and your unhappy eiTor 
woald be quite forgotten. 

" She wished you would put 
yourself into your cousin's protec- 
tion entirely, and have notbiug 
more to say to Mr. Belford." 

And I would recommend it

your most serious consideration, 
my dear Hiss Clary, whether now, 
aa your cousin (who is your 
trustee for your grandfauier's 
estate) is come, you should not 
give over all thoughta of Mr. 
Lovelace's intimate friend far 
your executor; more eipetnally, 
as that gentleman's interferius m 
the concerns of your family, 
ahould the sad event take place 
(which ray heart aches but to 
think of) might be attended with 
those consequences which you are 
so desirous, in other cases, to ob- 
viate and prevent. And suppose, 
my dear young lady, yon were to 
write one letter more to each of 
your unelea, to let them know 
how ill you are — and to ask their 
advice, and offer to be governed 
by it, in relation to the dispoaition 
ofyour estalo and effects? — Me- 
thinks I wish you would. 

1 find they will send you up a. 
large part of what has been re- 
ceived from that estate , since it 
was yours; together with your cur- 
rent cash, which you left behind 
you: and this by your cousin 
Morden , for fear you should have 
contracted debta which may make 
you nneasy. 

They seem to expect, that you 
will Wish to live at your grand- 
father's house, in a private man-

Nevertheless, in reading it, she 
was forced to leave off several 
times through weakness and a

complained; if 1 may say cnm-

She was very much affected at 
divers parto of this letter. She 
wept several times , and sighed 
often. Mrs. Lovick told me , that

read; — Her unkind, her atiel Sro-

When I was admitted to her

she , a long and not very pleasing 
letter from my dear Mrs. Norton. 
It will soon be in your bands. I 
am advised against appointiug 
you to the office you have so kind- 
ly accepted of: but you must re- 
sentnothing of these things. My 
choice will have no odd appearance 
to them: but it is now too late to 
alterit, if I would. 

I woidd fain write an answer to 
it, continued she: but I have no 
distinct sight, Mr. Belford, no 
steadiness of fingers — this mis- 
tineas however, will perhaps be 
gone hy-aad-by. _ Then turning

but say, that he thinks you a

and that you have the reputation 
of being thought a generous man 
in every instance but where the 
aei is concerned. In gurJi, he 
owns, that you have taken inex- 
cusable liberties. And he is sorry 
to say, that there are very few 
young men of fortune but who 
allow themselves in the same. 
Both sexes, he observes , too much

And so, my friends, said she, have 
I heard of a patient who actually

was an emperor, Uie Emperor Jo-

cousin, aa he knew not how ill she 
was, to hasten up? 

By no means, she said ; since, if 
he were not already set out, she 
was persuaded that she should be 
so low by the time he could receive

Tarn urgencj of the case, and 
the opportunity by your servant, 
will Bufiiciently apofogize for this 
troahle from a stranger to your 
person; who, however, is not a 
stranger to yonr merit. 

I understand you are employ- 
ing your good offices, with the 
parents of MissClarissft Uarlowe, 
and other relations, to reconcile 
them to the most meritorious 
daughter and kinswoman that 
ever family had to boast of. 

Generously as this ia intended 
by you, we here have too much 
reason to think all your aolici- 
todea on this head will be un- 
necessary: for it is tlie opinion of 
every one who has the honour of 
being admitted to her preseoce, 
that she cannot live over three 
days: so that if you wish to see 
her alive, you must lose no time to 
come up. 

She knows not that I write. 1 
had done it sooner, if 1 had had 
the least doubt that before now 
dhe would not have received from 
yon some news of the happy 
effects of your kind mediation in 
bar behalf. I am, Sm, 

Your most humble servant,

three or four times a day, re-

ride back; and, in view of Ui-

Yesterday, in particular, to 
give you an idea of the strength 
of that imijatience, which! cannot 
avoid suffering to break out upon 
my servants , 1 h ad no sooner dis- 
patched Will, than I took horse 
to meet him on his return. 

In order to give him time, 1 
loitered abont on the road , riding 
up iMs lane to the one highway, 
down thai to the other, just as my 
horse pointed; all the way curaing 
my very being; and ihoiigh so 
lately looking duwn upon all the 
world, wishing to change condi- 
tionB with the poorest beggar that 
cried to me for charity as I rode 
by him — and throwing him 
money, in hopes to obtain Dj his 
prayers the blessing my heart 
pants after. 

After i had sauntered about an 
hour or two (which seeped three 
or four tedious ones) fearing I had 
alipt the fellow, 1 inquired at 
every turnpike, whether a servant 
in Bucb a livery had not passed 
" jagb in iiis retuiii from Lon-

in so short ft compass! 

Yet all this time, though lonj

dread to meet him , lest he shoul

She was ready to faint, and 
choosing to lie down, 1 withdrew: 
I need not say, with a melancholy 
heart: and when I was got to my 
new taken apartment, my heart 
was still more affected by the 
sight of the solemn letter the ad- 
mirable lady had so lately finished. 
It was communicated to me by 
Mrs. Lovick; who had it to copy 
for me; but it was not to be de-

far, as to prevail upon the widow

account of such sums shall like- 
wise be taken without question- 
ing; the money, however, which I 
left behind me in my escritoire, 
being to be taken in part of those 
disbursements. 

Mv grandfather, who, in his 
goodness and favonrto me, knew 
no bounds, wa^ pleased to be- 
queath to me all the family pic- 
tures at his late house, some of 
which are very masterly perform- 
ances; with command, that if I 
died unmarried, or if married and 
had no descendants, they should 
then go to that son of his (if more 
than one should be then living) 
whom I shonid think would set 
most value by them. Now, as I 
know that my honoured nncle, 
JohnHarlowe, Esq. was pleased 
to express some concern that they 
were not left to him, as eldest son ; 
and as he has agallery where they 
maybeplaced to advantage; and 
as I have reason to believe, that 
he will bequeath them to my fa- 
ther, if he survive him; who, no 
doubt, willleave them to my bro- 
ther; I therefore bequeath all the 
said family pictures to my said 
uncle John Harlowe. In these 
pictures, however, I conclude not 
one of my own, drawn when I was 
aboutfourteenyearsof age; which 
I shall hereafter iu another article 
bequeath. 

My said honoured grandfather 
having a great fondness for the 
old family ^late, which he would 
never permit to be changed, hav-

would forward his desire; which

should be kept to tlie end if lime; 
this fomilf plate, which la de- 
jioaited in a large iron cheat, in the 
strong room al hia late dwelling-

honoured uncle Antony Ilarlowe, 
Esc(,: with the same mjunctiouH 
whicD were laid on me; nol 
doubting but he will confirm and 



friend, Mrs, Judith Norton, to 
whoae piety and care, aeconding 
the piety and care of my evei- 
honoured and enoellent mother, 1 



yearaof ray life, made me beloved 
and respected , the full sum of six 
hundred pounds , to be paid her 
within three months after my 
death. 

I bequeath also to the f 
good woman thirty guineas, for 
mourning, for her and for her " " 
niy foster-brother. 

To Mrs. Dorothy Hervcy, the 
only aiater of my honoured mo- 
ther, I bequeath the sum of fifty 
Kin'^Hs for a ring; and I beg of

knowledgments for all her good-

particularly for her patienee with 
" " ■ thoMveral altercations that 



happened between mybrotberani

departure from Uarlowe Place. 

To my kind and much Yiivt 
couaiu Miss Dolly Hervey, dau^

my watch and equipage, w' —

dresses and raffles ; also my gi)in

As my siater haa a rery pp

three trifles, in remembrance of

liau masterwhom he brought over 
with btm ; and which he presented 
tome, thati might bestow it, as 
he was pleased to say, upon the 
inau whom I should be one day 
moat inclined to favour. 

To the same gentlemau I also 
be<}ueath my rose diamond ring, 
which was a present from his good 
father to me; and will be the 
more valuable to him on that ac- 

I humbly request Mrs. Anna-

respectful thanks for all her 
favours and goodness to me, when 
I wassofrequentlya visilortoher

about which time my dear Miss 
Howe and I began to know, to dis- 
tinguish, and to love one another 
^o dearly — 1 cannot express how 
dearly — I becjueath to ftiat sister 
of my heart; of whose friendship, 
lis well in adversity as prosperity, 
when 1 was deprived of all other 
comfort and comforters, 1 have 
had such instances, as that oor 
love can only be exceeded in that 
atateof perfection, in whichi hope 
to rejoice with her hereafter, to all 
eternity. 

1 bequeath also to the same dear 
friend my beat diamond ring, 
wbich, with other jewels, is in the 



also all Diy finished and framed 
pieces of needle- work, the flower- 
piece excepted, which 1 have al- 
ready bequeathed to my cousin 
Morden. 

These pieces have all been 
taken down, aa 1 have heard*; 
and my relatious will have no

capital piece, as it is called, ex-

that ill health continue, 1 cot

my good Mrs. Norton to be put 
upoum^ poor's fund, hereafter to 
be mentioned. 

To the coachman , groom, and 
two footmen, and five maids 
Harlowe Place, I bequeath 1 
pounds each; to the helper, five 
pounds. 

To my siater's maid Betty 
Barnes, I bequeath ten pouada, to 
shew that I resent not lormer dis- 
obligations; which I believe were 
owing more to the insolence of of- 
fice, and to natural pertness , than 
to personal ill-will. 

All my wearing apparel, of 
whatever sort, that I have not 
beenohliged top&rtwttli,or which 
ii not already bequeathed, (my 
lioen eicepted) J desire Mrs. Ni 
ton will accept of. 

The trunks and boxes in which 
my clothes are sealed up, 1 desire 



may not be opened, 
sence of Mrs. Norton (or of 






one deputed by her) and of Mrs. 

To the worthy Mrs, Lovick 
above-mentioned, from whom 1 
have received great civilities, and 
even maternal kindnesses : and to 
Mrs, Smith, (with whom 1 lodge) 
ironi whom also I have received 
great kindnesses ; I bequeath all 
my linen, and all my unsold laces; 
to be divided eaually between 
J them, as they shall agree: or, in 
I.Mwe of disagreement, the same to 



be sold, and the money arising to 
be equally shared by them. 

And X bequeath to the same 
two good women, as a further 
token of my thankful acknow- 
ledgements of their kind love and 
compassionate concern for mo, 
the sum of twenty guineas each. 

To Mr. Smith, the husband of 
Mrs. Smith above named, I be- 
queath the sum of ten guineas, in 
acknowledgement of his civilities 

To Katharine, the honest maid- 
servant of Mrs. Smith, to whom 
(having no servant of my own) I 
have Been troublesome, I be- 
queath five guineas; and ten gui- 
neas more, mtieu of asuitofmy 
wearing - apparel , which once, 
with some linen, I thought of 
leaving to her. With this she 
may purchase what may be more 
'■■'•ible to her likingand degree, 
1 the honest and careful 
widow AnneShelhume, my nurse, 
over and above her wa^es, and 
the customary perquisites that 
may belong to her, 1 nequeath the 
sum of ten guineas. Hers is a 
careful, and (to persons of such 
humanity and tenderness) a me- i 
lancholy employment, attended 
'— the latter part of life with great 
itching and fatigue, which is 
hardly ever enough considered. 
The few books I have at my

In tbe middle drawer of mj 
eacritgire at Ilarlowe Place, are 
many letters, and copies of letters, 
put up according to their dates, 
which I have written or received 
in a course of years (ever since I 
learned to write) from and to my 
grandfather, my father and mo- 
ther, royuucles, my brother and 
sister, on occasional little ab- 
sences; my late uncle Morden, 
raj cousin Morden; Mrs. Norton, 
and Miss Howe, and other of my 
comiianioiiB and frieuds, before 
my confinement at my father's: 
»s alao from the three reverend 
gentlemen, Dr. Blome. Mr. Arnold, 
ftud Mr. Tomkins now with God, 
and the very reverend Dr. Leweii, 
on serious subjects. As these let- 
ters exhibit a correapondenoe that 
no person of my se: need to be 
ashamed of, allowing for the time 
of life when mine were written; 
and aa many excellent things are 
contained iu tlioae written to me; 
imd as Miss Howe, to whom most 
of them have been communicated, 
wished formerly to have them, if

I bequeath them to my said de^r 
fi-icna Miss Anna Uowc ; and the 
rather, aa she had for some years 
past a very conaiderable share in 
Qie correspondence. 

I do hereby make, constitute,

last will and testament; havinf 
previously obtained his leave w

which induced me to ask tl'

hope, (when he underatandaitto

and who will perhaps be so good

that he will uot seek by law,

Howe and her mother, to collect 
the particulaj'B of my sad story, 
nnd given espectatiou that I 
would, in order to do my character 
justice with all my iriends and 
companions; but not having time 
before me for the pfiinlul task, it 
has been a pleasore to me to find, 
by extracts kindly communicated 
to me by my said executor, that I 
may safely trust my famf ■ - ■"- - 
justice done me bj-Mr. Li 
in his letters to him my said 
cutor. And an Mr. Belford 
engaged to contribute what 1 
hts poirer towards a, compilement 
to be made of all that relate to 
mj' story, and knows my whole 
miud In this respect, it ia my de- 
sire that he will cause two c 
to be made of this collection 
to remain with Miss Howe, 
other with himself; and that he 
will shew or lend his copy, if re- 

auired, to my aunt Hervey, for 
le satisfaction of any of my fa- 
mily; bat under such restrictions 
as the said Mr. Belford shall think 
fit to impose; that neither any 
other person's safety may be en- 
dangered, nor his own honour 
Bnffer by the communication. 

I bequeath to my said executor 
the snm of one hundred guineas, 
as a grateful though insufficient 
acknowledgment ofthe trouble he 
will be at id the execution of the 
trust he has BO kindly undertaken.

twenty guineas for a ring; and 
that be will reimburse himself for 
all the charges and expenses 
which he shalfbe at in the execu- 
tion of this trust. 

In the worthy Dr. H. I have 
found a physician, a father, and 
a friend. 1 beg of him, as a testi- 
mony of my gratitude, to accept 
of twenty guineas for a ring. 

I have the same obligations to 
the kind and skiliiil Mr. Goddard, 
who attended me as my apothe- 
cary. His very moderate bill I 
have discharged down to yester- 
day. I have always thought it in- 
cumbent upon testators to shorten 
all they cau the trouble of their 
executors. I know I underrate 
the value of Mr. Goddard's at- 
tendances, when over and above 
what may accrue from yesterday, 
to the hour that will linish all, t 
desire fifteen guineas for a ring 
may be presented to him. 

To the reverend Mr. , who 

frequently attended me, and 
prayedby meinmy lastatages, I 
also bequeath fifteen guineas for 

There are a set of honest in- 
digent people, whom I used to call 
myponr, and to whom Mrs. Norton 
conveys relief each month (or at 
shorter peiiodsl in proportion to 
their necessities, from a sum I 
deposited in her bands, and from 
time to time recruited , as means 
accrued to me; but now nearly 
if not wholly expended ; nnw, 
that my fauft may he as little 
aggravated aa possible, by the 



r 



S74 I 

relieve ; and aa the produce of my 
grandfather's eatate (including 
the moiety of the buibb he had by 
him. aua was pleased to give roe 
at his death, as above- mentioned ) 
together with what I shall further 
appropriate to the same us 
Buhaequent articlea, will, aa 1 
hope, more than answer all my 
legacies and bequests; itisroy will 
and desire, that the remainder, 
be it little or much , shall become 
a fund to be appropriated, and 
I hereby direct that it be appro- 
priated, to the hke pnrposes with 
the aums which I put into Mrs. 
Norton's hands as aforesaid — 
and this under the direction and 
management of the aaid Mrs. 
Norton, who knows my whole 
mind in this particular. And in 
caseof her death, or of herdeaire 
to be acquitted of the manage- 
ment thereof, it is my earnest re- 
queat to my dear Miss Howe, that 
she will take it upon herself, and 
that at her own death ahe will 
tranafer what ahall remain undis- 
posed of at the lime, to such per- 
sons, and with such limitations, 
reatrictions, and provisoes, as she 
shall think will best answer my 
intention. For, as to the manage- 
ment and diatiibution of all or 
anypartofit, while in Mra. Nor- 
ton'a hands, or her own; I will, 
that it be entirely discretional, 
and without account, either to my 
executor, orany other person. 

AlthoughMrs. Norton, aa I have 
hinted, knows my whole mind in 
tbia respect; yet it may be proper 
ention, in this last solemn 
that mv intention ia, that 




this fund be entirely set aj. .___ 

appropriated to relieve tempo- 
rarily, from the interest thereof, 
(as I dare say it will be pnt out to 
the best advantage) or evert from 
the principal, if need be, tha 
honeat, industrioita , labonrinf 
poor only: when aicknees, lamb- 
neaa, unforeaeen losses, or othet- 
accidents , disable them fion< 
following their lawful callings; or 
to assist such honest people at 
laree families, as shall have k 
child of good inclinatione to pnt 
out to service, trade, or hus- 
bandry. 

It haa'always been a rule witii 
me, inmy little donations, to en- 
deavour to aid and set forward 
the sober and induatrious poor- 
Small helpa, if aeasonably asord- 
ed, will do for such; and so the 
fund may bo of more eitenstrs 
benefit; an ocean of wealth will 
not be sufficient for the idle aod 
dissolute; whom therefore, sinGB 
they will be always in want, 
will be no charity to relieve, 
worthier creatures woald, by te- 
heving the others, be deprived 
of such assistance as may set the 
wheels of their industry go' 
and put them in a sphere of as 
action. 

But it is my eipress will 
direction, that let this fund c 
out to be ever so considerable, it 
shall be applied only in anpnoit 
of the leniporary exigencies of ths 
persona I have described; i 
that no one family or person 
ceive from it, at oae time or 
year, more than the eum of 



HARLOWE. 



Itismywill and desire, that the

Signed, sealed, published, and

seven sheets of paper, all

They were all extremely Unehed 
with the preamble. 

The first words of the wiD — 
"I, Clarissa Harlowe, now bj

what they will, Mr. Belford, the 
first reading a will, where a per- 
son dies worth any thing consider- 
able, generally affords a true test 
of the relationB' love to the de- 
ceased. 

The clothes, the thirty guineas 
for mourning to Mrs. Norton, with 
the recommendation of tbe good 
woman for housekeeper at Ok 
Gr'iiie, were thought sufficient, 
had the article of 6fflV. which was 
called monstrous, been omitted. 
Some other passages in the will 
were called flighls, and nucA lehm- 
iies as diatinguiak people ofanagi- 
naiitm from those of judgment. 

My cousin Dolly Hervey was 
erudged the library. Miss Har- 
lowe said, that as she and her 
sister never bought the name 
books, she would take that to her- 
self, and would male il up to her 
cousin Dolly one way or vlher. 

I intend, Mr, Belford, to save 
you tbe trouble of interposing 
— the library stall be my consin 
Dolly's. 

Mrs. Hervey could hardly keep 
her seat. On ihii occasion, how- 
ever, she only said, that her late 
dear and ecer dear niece was loo 
good to her and hern. But, al an- 
olhei- lime, she declared with teaft; 
that she could not forgive herself 
for a letterahewrofe,* looking at 
Miaa Arabella, frhom, it seema, 
unkuonrn to any body, she had 
consulted before she wrote it, and 
which, she said, must have 
wounded a spirit, that now, she 
saw, had beentoo deeply wounded 
before.

This collection having ma into 
a much ^'eater length than was 
wished, it is thought proper to 
omit several letters that passed 
botwecD Col. Morden, Mi<isUowe, 
Mr. BeUord, and Mr. Hickman, in 
relation to the esecution of the 
lady's will, &c. 

It is however necessary to oV 
s<?rve on this subject, that the un- 
happy mother, being supported by 
the two uncles, influenced the 
afflicted father to overrule ail his 
sou's objections, nud to direct a 
literal observation ofthewill- and 
at the same time to give up all the 
sums which he was empowered by 
it to reimburse himself; as also to 
take upon himself to defray the 
^ncral eipcnses . 

Mr. Belford so mucb obliged 
Miss Howe by bis steadiness^ 
equity, and dispatch, and bj his 
n>ndine>s lo contrilnite to" the of 
dIrectMt colWUiui. that she volon- ' 



tative of her beloved friend. In 
thccoursGof which, becommuni- 
cated to her (in confidence) the 
letters which passed betweenhtm 
and Mr. Lovelace, and, by Colonel 
Mordcn's consent, those which 
passed between that gentleman 
and himself. 

Ue sent with the first parcel of 
letters which he had transcribed 
out of short hand for Ittiaa Howe, a 
letter to Mr. Hickman, dated the 
IGth of September, in wluch he 
expresses himself as follows : 

" But I ought, sir,ia this pared, 
to have kept out one letter. It i* 
that which relates to the interriew 
between yoorself and Mr. Love- 
lace, at Mr. Dormer's.* In wfaioli 
Mr. Lovelace treata you with an 
air of levity, which neither yoar 
person , your character , aor TOOT 
commission deserved; but inuck 
was his iisfjai wag oflrvatrngtitft 
one ickose businesshetcasnot phaM

much greatness of mind to bidh^ 
turbed at the contents of this letter, 
shonld Miss Howe commiiniGate 
them to you; and the rather, vit 
is impossible that youahonldsttfo I 
with her on that account" 

Mr. Belford then en 
Lovelace, as a goodnatured m 




stanceaof his still greater fri 

with himself. 

To this Mr. Hickman anmreni 

in his letter of the 18th:

vou, that I hate your whole sex for

have not yet found out.

Dut I must not touch upon the

Mr. Belford, in his answer, pro- 
mises, that she shall be the pur- 
chaaer of the jewels, if they come 
into bis bands. 

He acquaints her, that the fa- 
mily had given Col. Morden the 
keys of all that belonged to the 
dear departed: that the unhappy 
motbor had (as the will allows) 
ordered a piece of needlework to 
be set aside for her, and had 
desired Mrs, Norton to get the 
little book of meditaliofix tran- 
scribed, and to let her have the 
original, as it waa all of her dear 
daughter's hand-writing; and as 
it might, when she could bear to 
look into it, adminiater consolation 
to herself. And that she had like- 
wise reserved for herself her pic-

oeent creatures, who may be 
drawn id bj your wicked arts and 
periurieB. You have not, in my 
wiailieB for your future welfare, 
the wiabea of a suppliant wife, 
endeavouring for hev ovm sake, as 
-well as for yours, to induce yon to 
reform those ways. They are 
wholly as disinterested as nnds- 
serred. But 1 should mistrust my 
own penitence, were 1 capable of 
wishing to recompense evil for 
evil — if, black as your offences 
have been against me, I could not 
forgive, as 1 wish to be forgiven. 

I repeat, therefore, that 1 do 
forgive Ton. And may the Al- 
mighty forgive you too! Nor have 
l,atttiewrit)Dgof this, any other 
essential reerets than what are 
occasioned by the grief I have 
given to parents , who , till 1 knew 
you, were the most indulgent of 
I parents', by the scandal given to 
the other branches of my family ; 
' by the disreputation brought upon 
^ nysex; and by the offence given 
I to virtue in my fall. 
' Ah to myself, you have only 
robbed me of what once were 
my favourite eipectations in the 
transient life I shall have quitted 
when you receive this. You have 
only been the cause that 1 have

Land of cartailing a life, that might

hour I had lived with him might 
have brought with it some new 
trouble. AndIam(indeedthrough 
sharp afflictions and distresses) 
indebted to you, secondarily, as I 
humbly presume to hope, for so 
many years of glory, as might 
have proved years of danger, 
temptation, and anguish, had £ey 
been added to my mortal life. 

So, til, though no thanks to 
your inlerttioii , you have done me 
realservke; and in return, Iwish 
you happv. But such has been 
your life hitherto, that you can 
have no time to lose in setting 
about your repentance, Eepent- 
atice to such as have lived only 
carelessly, and in the omission of 
their re^lar duties, and who 
□ever aimed to draw auy poor 
creatures into evil , is not so easy 
a task, nor so much in our own 
power, as some imagine. How 
difBcult a grace tlien to be ob- 
tained, where the guilt is preme- 
ditated, wilful, and complicated! 

To say I once respected you 
with a preference, is what I ought 
to blush to own , since, at the very

LETTER CLI, 
r. LoicUcc to John BelFoiil , Esq. 

WHITE to demand back ag^n 
my last letter. I own it was my 
mind ftt the different times I wrote 
it; and whatever ailed me, I could 
not help writing it. Suchagloomy 
impnlBe eame upon me, and iu- 
creased as I wrote, that, for my 
Boul, I could not forbear running 
Into the miserable. 

'Tis atrange, very strange, that 
_ man's conscience should De able 
to force his fingers to write whe- 
ther he will or not ; and to run him 
into a subject he more than once, 
at the rery time, resolved not to 
think of. 

Nor is it less strange, that (no 
jOew reason occurring) be should 

>A d(V or two more, so totally 



change bis mind; have his miud, 
1 should rather say, so wholly il- 
lumiuatcd hygayliopes and nsIsK 
prospects, as to be ashamed en 
what he had written. 

For, on re-perusal of a copy of 
myletter, which fell into my hands 
by accident, in the hand-writing 
ofmy cousin Oh art otte , who, un- 
known to me , had trauacribed it, 
1 find it to be such a letter, as an 
enemy would rej oiee to see. 

This 1 know, that were I to have 
continued but one week more in 
the way 1 was in when I wrote the 
latter part of it, I should bare 
beencunflued, and in straw, Uie 
□eit : for I now recollect , that all 
my distemper was returning upon 
me with irresistible violence — 
and that iu spite of water-grnd 
and soupe-maigre. 

1 own,thatl am still exceseiveW 
grieved at the disappointment this 
admirable woman made it so 
much herwhimsical choice to give 
me. But , since it has thus f^en 
out; since she was determined to 
leave the world; and since ahe 
actually ceases lo be; ought I, who 
have such a share of life and 
health in hand, to indulge gloomy 
reflectioaB upon an event that is 

Eaaeed: and, (einq passed, cannot 
e recalled? — Have I not bad 
a specimen of what will be my

lady's papers: whenever I would 
abhor my former ways, I will read 
some of thine and copies of my 
own. 

The consequence of all this will 
be, that I shall be the delight of 
my own relations of both sexes, 
who were wont to look upon me as 
a lost man. I shall have good 
order in my own family, because 
I shall give a good example my- 
self I shall be visited and re- 
spected, not perhaps by Lovelace, 
by Mowbray, and by Tourville, 
because they cannot see me upon 
the old terms, and will not, per- 
haps, see me upon the new, but by 
the best and worthiest gentlemen, 
clergy as well as laity , all around 
me. I shall look upon my past 
follies with contempt; upon my 
old companions with pity. Oaths 
and curses shall be for ever ba- 
nished from my mouth : in their 
place shall succeed conversation 
becoming a rational bein^ , and a 
gentleman. And instead of acts 
of offence, subjecting me perpe- 
tually to acts of dqence, wifl I 
endeavour to atone for my past 
evils , by doing all the good in mj 
power, and by becoming an uni- 
versal benefactor to the extent of 
that power. 

Now tell me, Lovelace, upon 
this faint sketch of what I hope to 
r/o,and to &e, if this benotascneme 
infinitely preferable to the wild, 
the pernicious, the dangerous 
ones, Doth to body and soul, which 
we have pursued*? 

I wish I could make my sketch 

aa amiable to jou, as it appeaxe to ^„*«««. ^...„«„^. 

me, I wish it with fd\ my soxiV\\ N^^\.\vw^Twsrn]lle and Uow- 



for I always loved you. It has 
been my misfortune that I did : for 
this led me into infinite riots and 
follies, of which, otherwise, I 
verily think, I should not have 
been guilty. 

You have a great deal more to 
answer for than I have, were it 
only in the temporal ruin of this 
admirable woman. Let me now, 
while yet vou have youth, and 
health, and intellect, prevail upon 
you: for I am afraid, very much 
afraid , that such is the enormity 
of this single wickedness, in de- 
priving the world of such a shining 
light , that if you do not quickly 
reform, it will be out of your 
power to reform at all ; and that 
rrovidence, which has already 
given you the fates of your agents 
Sinclair and Tomlinson , to take 
warning by, will not let the princi- 
pal offender escape, if he slight 
the warning. 

You will , perhaps , laugh at me 
for these serious reflections. Do, 
if you will. I had rather you 
should laugh at me for continwng 
in this way of thinking and acting, 
than triumph over me, as you 
threaten, on my swerving from 
purposes I have determined upon 
with such sood reason, and in- 
duced and warned by such 
examples. 

And so much for this subject at 
present. 

I should be glad to know when 
you intend to set out. I have too 
much concern for your welfare, 
not to wish you in a thinner air, 
and more certain climate.

That's the horrid thing; a man 
cannot begin to Hank, but cataes 
for thought crowd in upon him: 
the gloomy takes place, and mirth 
and gaiety abandon his heart for 

Poor M'Donald ! — I am rpally 
Bonr for the fellow. — He was an 
useful, faithful, solemn varlet, 
who could act incomparably any 
part givenbim, and knennutwhat. 
a. blush was. — He really took ■ 
honest pains for me in the last 
affair; which has cost him and me 
BO dearly in reflection. Often 
gravelled, as we both were, yet 
was he never daunted. Poor 
M'Donald , I must once more say ! 
— For cairyiuE on a solemn piece 
ofroguery, hehadnoequal. 

I was BO solicitous to know if he 
were really as bad as thou bast a 
knack of painting every body 
whom thou singlest out toexereiso 
thy murdering pen upon, that I 
dispatched a man and horse to 
Maidstone, as soon as I had thine ; 
and had word brought me, that he 
died in two hours after he had 
received thy five guineas. And 
all thou wrotest of his concern in 
relation to the ever-dear Miss Har- 
lowe, it seems, was true. 

I can't help it, Belford! — I 
have only to add , that it is happy 
that the poor fellow lived not to 
be hanged, as it seems he would 
have been: for who knows, as he 
had got into such a penitential 
strain, what might have been in 
hisdying speech?

LETTER CLV. 
Mr. Lovelace to John Belford, Esq. 

But what a pretty scheme of 
life hast thou drawn out for thy- 
self, and thy old widow! \^y my 



BDtil, Jack, I am mightily taken 
with it. There is but one thing 
wanting in it; tiiid that will come 
of course: only to be in the com- 
mission, and one of the quorum. 
Thou art already provided with a 
clerk, as good asthou'lt waut, in 
the widow Lovick; for thon un- 
derstandest law, and she con- 
icience: a good lord chancellor 
ji^etween ye I — I should take pro- 
CrdieiouEi pleasure to hear thee de- 
I in a bastard case upon thy 
notions, ajid old remem- 



, .Airsoflevityl) if, after all, thou 
canst so easily repent and reform, 
»thoathinkestthoucanst:if thou 



master will bo readily dit 
tried and so faithful a servant, and 
permit thee thus calmly to enjoy 
thy new system; no room for 
Bcandal; all temptation ceasing; 
and if at last (thy reformation 
warranted and approved by time) 
ttioamarriesC, and livest honest: 
— whvBelford, I cannot but say, 
that if all these IF's come to pass, 
thou standest a good chance to be 
a happy man ! 

All I think , as I told thee in m^ 

last, is, that the devil knows his 

own iatereat too well, to let thee 

off so easily. Thou thyself tellest 

me, that we caimot repent when 

I ire will. And indeed 1 found it 

b^BO: for, in my lucid intervals, 1 

Kmade good resolutions; but, as 

Kjtealth turned its blythe side to 



390 

me, and opened my ptospecta of 
recovery, all my old inclinatioiiE 
and appetites returned; and this 
letter, perhaps, will be a thorough 
conviction to thee, that I aia as 
wild a fellow us ever, or iu the 
way to be BO. 

Thou askcat me very seriously, 
if, upon the faint sketcli thou hast 
drawn , thy new scheme be not in- 
finitely preferable to any of those 
which we have so long pursued? 
— Why, Jack — let me reflect — 
why, Belford — I can't say ^I 
can't say — but it is. To speak 
out — it is really , as Biddy iu the 
play Bays, a good comfortable 
scheme. 

But when thou telleat me , that 
it was thy misfortune to love me, 
because thy value for me made 
thee a wickeder man than other- 
wise thou would'st have been; I 
desire thee to revolve this asser- 
tiou: and I am persuaded, that 
thou wilt not find thyself in bo 
right a train as thou imaginest. 

Nofalse colourings, noglo&Bes, 
does a b'ue penitent aim at. De- 
basement, diflidence , mortifica- 
tion, contrition, are all near of kin, 
Jack; and inseparablo from a re- 
pentant spirit. — If thouknowest 
not this, thou art not got three 
steps (out of threescore) towards 
repentanceandamendment. And, 
let me remind thee, before the 
grand accuser come to do it, that 
tliou wert ever above being a pas- 
sive follower in iniquity, Thoogh 
thonhadst not so good an inven- 
tion as he to whom thou writest, 
thou hadst tu active an. luMi^ts»

mischief as ever I met with in 
man. 

Then for improving an hint, 
thou wert always a true English- 
man. I never started a roguery, 
that did not come out of thy forge 
in a manner ready anvilled and 
hammered for execution, when I 
have sometimes been at a loss to 
make any thing of it myself. 

What indeed made me appear 



saved the lady from the ruin she 
met with. Thou art a pretty fel- 
low for this ; for kow would*st thou 
have saved her? What methods 
didst thou icike to save her? 

Thou knewest my designs all 
along. Hadst thou a mind to 
make thyself a good title to the 
merit to which thou now pretend- 
est to lay claim, thou should'st, 
like a true knight -errant, have 



to be morewicked than thou, was, I sought to set the lady free 



that I being an handsome fellow, 
and thou an ugly one, when we 
had started a game , and hunted 



from the enchanted castle. Thou 
should'st have apprised her of her 
danger ; have stolen in when the 



it down , the poor frighted puss ; siant was out of the way: or hadst 
generally threw herself into my thou had the true spirit oichivaby 
paws, rather than into thine: and j upon thee, and nothing else would 
then, disappointed, hast thou have done, have killed the giant; 
wiped thy blubber -lips, and and then something would'st thou 
marched off to start a new game, ', have had to brag of. 
calling me a wicked fellow all the ; *' O but thegiant was myfineud: 
while. I he reposed a confidence in me: 

In short, Belford, thou wert an and I should have betrayed m^ 
excellent starter and setter. The friend, and his confidence!** This 
old women were not afraid for thou would*st have pleaded, no 
their daughters, when they saw doubt But try this plea upon 
such a face as thine. But, when thy present principles, and tnoa 
/ came , whip was the key turned wilt see what a caitiff thou wert to 
upon the girls. And yet all signi- let it have weight with thee, upon 
fied nothing ; for love , upon oc- an occasion where a breach of 
casion, wia draw an elephant confidence is more excusable than 
through a key>hole. But for thy to keep the secret Did not the 
HKART, Belfbra, who ever doubted lady herself once put this veiy

Nor even in this affair , that thou not on that occaaion heavily 
sticks most upon me, which my blame thyself ^? 
conscience makes such a handle Thou canst not pretend, and I 
of a^nst me, art thou so innocent know thou wilt not, Uiat thou wert 
as thou fanciest thyself. Thou afraid of thy life by talcing audi ft 
wilt staure at this: fiut it is true, measure: for a braver fellow Irres 
aiui 1 will convince thee of it in not nor a more fearless, than Jack

stances, and thou canat uot forget 
them, where thou liast ventured 
thj bones, thy neck, tb; life, 
Bigainst numbers in a, cause ot 
roguery ; and hailst thou had a 
spark of that virtue, whieh now 
thou art willing to flatter thyaelf 
thou hast, thou would'at surely 
have run a risk to save an in- 
nocence, and a virtue that it he- 
came every man to protect and 
espouse, Thia is the truth of the 
case, greatly as it makes against 
myself But I hate an hypocrite 
from my soul. 

I believe I should have killed 
thee at the ^wii', if Icould, hadst 
lliou betrayed lue thus. But 1 am 
surenoHT.thatI would have thank- 
ed thee for it, with all mj heart ; 
and thought thee more a father, 
and a frieud, than my real father, 
aud my best friend — and it was 
natural for thee to think , with bo 
eitalted a merit as this lady had, 
that this would have been the 
ease, when consideration took 
place of passion : or, rather, when 
that d— ned fondness for in- 
trigue ceased, whieh never was my 
pride BO much as it is now, upon 
reflection, my curse. 

Set about defending thyself, 
and 1 will prohe thee still deeper, 
!t»d convict thee still mori> effec- 
tually, that thou bast more guilt 
than merit even in this affair. And 
as to all the others, in which we 
were accnatomed to hunt in 
couples, thou wert always the for- 
vrardest whelp, and more ready by 
far, to run away with me, tbanl 
with thee. Yet canst thou now 
compote thy hone-mUBclcs, and 



401 

cry out. How much more hast 
thou, Lovelace, to answer for than 
1 have ! — Saying nothing, neither, 
when thou sayest this, were it 
frue: for thoQ wilt not be tried, 
when the time cornea, by cinapari- 
xim. In short thou ma^ 'at, at this 
rate, so miserably deceive thyself, 
that notwithstanding all thy self- 
denial and mortification, when 
thou closest thy eyes, thou may's! 
perhaps open them in a place 
where thou thoughtest least to 
he. 

However, consult thy old 
woman on this subject. Isnallbe 
thought to be out of character if I 
go ou in this strain. But really as 
to a title to merit in thia affair, I 
do assure thee. Jack, that thou 
less deservest praise than an 
horse-pond; and I wish I had the 
mousing of thee. 

1 AM actually now employed in 
taking leave of my friends in the 
country. I had once thought of 
taking To ml inson, as I called him, 
with me; but his destiny has 
frustrated that intention. 

Next Monday I think to see you 
intowni and then you, and I, and 
Mowbray and Tourville, will 
laugh otF that evening together. 
They will both accompany me (as 
I expect jiiK will) toDojrer, if not 
cross the water. I must leave you 
and them good friends. They 
take extremely amiss the treat- 
ment you have given them in your 
lastlettora. They say you strike 
at theh- understandings. I laugh 
at them; and tell them, tiiat those

a man bo dear to him as he haa 
^'always been, from the firet of 
piheiraaiuaintance; and who is 

Sable of thinking so rightly 
deeply; thoagn at present 
ktoanchUttie purpose, as makes 
' ' very knowledge 




subject that 1 must not, cannot 
diBpense with; as I promiBed the 
divine lady, that 1 would do every 



thing in my power to prevent that 
fiirthermischief of winch she was 
BO very apprehensive. 

I will not content myself with 
distant hints. It Ib with very great 
concern that I have just now 
heard of a declaration which you 
are aaid to have made to your re- 
lations at Harlowe Place, that 
you wilt not rest till you have 
avenged your couain's wrongs 
upon Mr, Lovelace. 

Far he it from me to offer to de- 
fend the unhappy roan, or even 
\indulyta extenuate his crime 1 But 
yet I must say, that the family, by 
theirperaecutions of the dear lady 
at first, and by their implacable- 
noss afterwards, ought, at least, 
to slutre the blame with him. 
There is even gi'Cat reason to be- 
lieve, that a lady of such a reli- 
giouB turn, her virtue neither to 
be florprised nor corrupted, her 
will inviolate, would have got over 
atneie perxdiKii injury ; eapecially 
as ho would have done all thatwat 
in his power to repair it; and as, 
from the application of all his fa- 
mily in hia favour , and other cir- 
cumstances attending his sincere 
and voluntary offer, the lady 
might have condescended, with 
greaterglory to herself, than if he 
id never offended. 
When 1 have the pleasure of 
se^g you next, I will acquaint 
-ou,air, with all thooiroumatances 
f this melancholy atory; from 
liich you will see, that tar, Love- 
lace was extremely ill treated at 
first by the wholefamily, thiaad- 
mirable lady excepted. This ex- 
ception, I know, lv«\^VsD&>a>k

crime : but us his principal ijiteu- 
tion was but to try her virtue ; and 
that he became so earnest a sup- 
pliant to her for tnarria^; and as 
he lias suffered bo deplorably in 
the loss of hia reason, for not 
having it in his poiver to repair her 
wrongs; I presume to hope, that 
much is to be pleaded against 
such a resolution as tou are said 
to hare made. I will read to you 
at the same time some pafsa^es 
liom letters of his; two of which 
(one but this moment received) 
will convince you, that the un- 
happy man. Who is but now re- 
covering his intellects, needs no 
greater punishment than what he 
has from his own reilectione. 

I have just now read ove 
copies of the dear lady's post- 
humous letters. I send them all 
to you, except that direeted foi 
Mr. Lovelace, which I reserve till 
I have the pleasure of seeing you. 
Lot me entreat you to reaa once 
more Ihat written to yourself, and 
Mdltoher brother*; which latter 
I now send you; as they are in

larly for your present kind inter- l

Almighty for ever bless you, dear 
sir, for the kindness you endea- 
voured to procure for me ! 

One principal end of my writing 
to you in thia solemn manner, is, 
to beg of you, which I do with the 
utmost earnestness, thatwhenyou 
come to hear the particulara ofmy 
story, you will not suffer aclice 
resentment to take place in your 
generous breaat on my account. 

Kemember, my dear cousin, 
that vengeance ia God's province, 
and he has undertaken to repay 
it; nor will you, I hope, iuvadle 
that province: — especially as 
there ia no neceaaity for you to 
attempt to vindicate my fame; 
since the offender himself (before 
he is called upon) lias stood forth, 
and offered to do me all thejustice 
that you could have e^itorted from 
him, had Hived: and when your 
own person may be endangered 
by running an equal liuk with a 
gui/ti/ man. 

Duelling, sir, I need not tell 
yov, who nave adorned a public 
character, is not only an usorna- 
tion of the divine prerogative, but 
it ia an insult upon magistracy 
and good government. "Tis an 
impious act. 'Tia an attempt to 
take away a life that ought not to 
depend uponaprivate sword: an 
act, the consequence of which is 
to huriT a soul (all its sins upon 
its head) into peraition; endanger-

SeeK not then, I beaeech you, 
sir, to aggravate my fault, by a

of that fault. Give not the u 
happy man the merit (were y( 
assuredly to he the victor) of fal

is the perfidious, the ungrateful 
deceiver; but will not the forfei- 
ture of uis life , and the probable 
loss of his soul , be a dreadful 
piation forhavingmadememii 
able for a few months only, and 
through that misery, by the divine 
favour, happy to all eternity? 

In such acafle,inycouBiii,wherfi

your avenger? 

Let the poor man's conscien

will one day find pimishment 
more than enough from that. 
liSave him to the chance of re- 
pentance. If the Almighty will 
give him time for it, why should 
you deny it him ? — Let him still 
be the guilty aggreasor; and Ie1 
no one say, Clarissa Harlowe it 
now amply revenged in his fall; 
or, in the case of yours, (which 
Heaveu avert!) that her fault, 
instead of being buried in her 
grave, is perpetuated, and ag- 
gravated,, by a loss far greater 
flianthat of herself.

give you 

I Rm obliged to you for tbe let- 
ten you have communicaited to 
me; and stiLftirther for your pro- 
mise to favour me with others oc- 
casionally. 

All that relates to my dear 
coUBinlahall beglad tosee, beit 
from whom it will. 

I leave to your own discretion, 
what may or may not be proper 
for Miss Howe to see from a pen 

I admire her Bpirit. Were she a 
man , do you think , sir , she at this 
iiiiie would have your advice Jo 
take, upon BuchaHuhJectas that 
upon which you write? 

Pear not, however, that your 
communications shall put ueupon 
any meaauies that otherwise I 
should not have taken. The wick- 
edness, sir, is of such a nature, as 
admits not of aggravation. 

Tet I do assure you, that I have 
not made any resolutions that will 
beatieu^ionuie. 

I have indeed expreased myself 
with vehemence upon the occa- 
sion. Who could forbear to do so? 
But it is not my way to resolve iu 
matters of moment, till oppor- 
tunity brings the execution of my 
purposes within my reach. We 
shall see by what manner of spirit 
this young man will be actuated, 
on his recovery. If he continue to 
brave and defy R family, which he 



407 

has so irreparably iiyuved — if ^ 
but resolutions ilepeodinK upon 
future contingencies are best left 
to future determination, asljnat 
now hinted. 

Meantime, I will own, that I 
think my cousin's arguments un- 
answerable. No go'ifi man but 
must be influenced by them. — 
But, alas! sir, who u good? 

As to your arguments ; I hope 
you will believe ine, when I as- 
sure you, as I now do, tbat^our 
opinion , and your reasonmga, 
have, and will always have , great 
and deserved weight withme: and 
that I respect you still more thanl 
did, if possible, for your eipostu- 
latious in support of my cousin's 
pious injunctions to me. They 
come from yoa, air, with the great- 
est propriety, as her executor and 
representative; and likewise as 
you are a man of humanity, and a 
well-wisher to both parties. 

I am not exempt from violent 

eissions,sir, any more than your 
iend; but then I hope they are 
only capable of being raised by 
other people's insolence, and not 
by vay own arrogance. If ever I 
iun stimulated by my imperfec- 
tions and my resentment to act 
against m^ judgment, and my 
cousin's injunctions; some such 
reflections as these that follow, 
will run away with my reason. 
Indeed they are always present

Then I reflect, too-too often per-

miaerabie for their lives? 

That the more faulty her friends 
were as to her, the more enorm-

more inexcusable — what! sir, 
wns it not enough, that sbe 
EufFered what she did for hint, 
but the barbarian must make 
her suffer for her sufferings for 
hU eakef — Passion makes me 
express this weakly: passion 
refuses the aid of expression 
sometimes, where the propriety 
of a resentment, /iranu/aei'e, de- 
clares expression to be needless. 
I leave it to yvu, air, to give this 
reflection its due force. 

That the author of this diffusive 
mischief perpetrated it pre- 
meditatedly, waotoulv, in the 
gaiety of his heart. To try my 
cousin, sayyoUj sir! To try the 
virtue of a Clarissa, sir! — Had

them, at the highest price, when 
I come to town, as well as for 
other matters that you were

These jewels 1 have presented '

acknowledgment of her love to . 
the dear departed. I have told 
Miss Howe of this; aud she ia as 
well pleased with what I have 
done, as if she had been the pur- 
chaser of them herself. Aa that 
young lady has jewels of her own, 
she could only have wished to 
purchase these because they were 
her beloved friend's, — Thegrand- 
mother's jewels are also valued; 
and the money will be paid me for 
you, to be carried to the uses of 
the will, 

Mrs. Norton is preparing, by

and from their first intimaiCy [i

Mrs. Norlonj each seeing some- 

' thing in the other to fear, a. -™ 

as to lore; yet making it a. ._ 
dispensable condition of tlieit 
friendship, each to tell the otba 
of her failings; and to be Aankfiil 
for the freedom taken. One bf 
nature gentle; the other madr iv 
by her Ince and admiraliin of bet 
eialtcd friend — impossible that 
there could be a friendship better 
calculated for duration. 

I must, however, take the liber^ 
to blame Miss Howe for her be< 
haviour to Mr. Hickman. And! 
infer from it, that even women ol 
senae are not to be trusted witk 

By the way, I am sure I n 
not desire you not to communi- 
cate to this fervent young lai^' 
the liberties 1 take with her ehii- 

I dare say, my cousin could not' 
approve ofMiss Howe's behaviour 
to this gentleman: a behaviour 
which is talked oi hii as many a 
knoio Mr. Hwktnan and her. Cann 
wise youag ladr be easy under 
Buchcensurc? SheTnuaf knowit 

Mr. Hickman is really a reef 
worthy man. Every body epeakf 
well of him. But he is gentle* 
disposition ed, and be adores W ' 
Howe; and love admits notof 
air of even due iVg^iily to the ob- 

J'ect of it. Yet will Mr. Hickman 
lardlyever get back the reins hft 
has yielded up; unless she, bf 
cftnying too far the power t**^ 
which ibe aeemi at presoit to 



Benstble, abould, when she has no 
'~ iurs to confer which he has not 

e' t to demand, provoke him 
ow off the too neavy yoke. 
And should he do so, and then 
treat her with negligeuce, Miss 
Hovm, of all the women I know, 
vrill be the least able to support 
berself andor it. She will then be 
Mord unhappy than she ever made 
iim; for a, man who is imeaay at 
home, can divert bimaclf abroad: 
trtiich a woman cannot so easily 
.do without scandal. — Permit me 
to take further notice as to Miss 
Sowe ; that it is very obvious to 
me, that she has, by her haughty 
<bebaviour to this worthy man, iti~ 
Tolved herself in one difficult 
-ftom which she knows not how to 
teitricate herself with that grace 
1 which accompanies all her actions. 
She inteuda to have Mr. Hickman. 
I believe she does not dislike him. 
And it will cost her no small pains 
to descend from the elevation to 
which she has climbed. 

Another inconvenience she will 
Buffer from her having taught 
every body (for she is above dis- 
guise) to think, by her treatment 
of Mr. Hickman, mvch more meanli/ 



^iuinour iu his dishonour? 

Mrs. Hone is much disturbed at, 
ber danghter's bebaviour to the 
gentleman. Ueis very deservedly 
a favourite of hera. But [another, 
failing in Mies Howe] ber mother 
has not all the authoritv with her 
that a mother ought to have. Miss 
Howe is indeed a womau of line 
eenae; but it requires a high de- 



gree of good understanding, 
well as a sweet and gentle dispo- 
sition of mind, and great discre- 
tion, in a child, when grown iij 
to let it be seen that she miugli 
reuerence with ber hoe, to a pi. 
rent, who has talents visibly infe- 

Mias Howe ia open, genernui, 
nobte. The mother has not any of 
her fine qualities. Parents, in 
order to preserve their children's 
veneration for them, should take 
great care not to let them see any 
thing in their conduct, or be- 
haviour, or principlos, which they 
themselves would not approve of 
in others. 

Mr. Hickman has, however, 
this consideration to comfort him- 
self with, that the same vivacity 
S which he suffers, makes Miss 
pwe's own mulher, at times, 
eqvallg sensible. And as he sees 
enough of this beforehand, he will 
have more reason to blame him- 
self than the lady, should she 
prove as lively a wife, as she was 
a mistress, for having continued 
his addresses, and married her, 
against such threatening ap- 
pparauces. 

There is also another circum- 
stance, which good-natured men 
who engage with even lively 
women, may look forward to with 
pleasure; a circumstance which 
generally lowers the spirits of the 
Isdies, and danteslicates them, as I 
may call it: and which, as it will 
bring those of Mr. Hickman and 
Miss Howe nearer to a par, that

reason, when it happe: 
grutulate himself upon. 

Bat after all, I see that there ia 
something so chiU'Tniitgly hrilliant 
and frank in Miss Howe b disposi- 
tion, althongh, at [irosent, visibly 
overclouded by grief, that it is 
impossible not to love her, even 
fur her failings. She may, and 
I hope she will, make Mr. Hick- 
man an obliging wife; and if ehe 
does, she will have additional 
merit with me; since she cannot 
be apprehensive of check or con- 
troui; and may therefore by her 
generositg and pnidence lay an 
obligation upon her husband, by 
the performance of what is no 
more than her dull/. 

Her mother both lnves and fearti 
her. Yet is Mrs. Hone also a 
woman of vivacity, and ready

when she ^ . 

she has, as I hinted above, ueo^'cn- 

edher authority by the 

of her mind. 

Yet once she praised her daugh- 
ter to mo with BO much warmlhtoi 
the generosity of her spirit, that 
had I not known the .old lady's 
character, I should have thought 
her generous liersdf. And yet I 
have always observed thatpcople, 
even of narrow tempera, are ready 
to praise geuerons onea: — and 
(ftujhave laeconnted for it; that 



The old lady applied herself to 
ne, to urge to the young one the 
ntenta of the frill, in ordei to 



hasten her to fix a day for her 
marriage: but de.iired that ] 
would not let Miss Howe knoil 
that she did. 

I took the liberty upon it to tefl 
Miss Howe, that I hoped that hef 
part of a will, i 
punctually, in aln 
articles, fulfiUed, 
the only one that wonid 
slighted. 

Her answer was, she would con- 
sider of it; and made 
tesy with such an air, as shewed 
me, that she thought me more on' 
of my sphere, than I conld alloi 
her to think me, had I been per- 
mitted to argue the point t'-"" 
her. 

I foimd MJBS Howe and her { 
servant maid in deep moumi ^ 
This, it seemB, had occasioned k 
great debate at first between ho 
mother and her. Her mother IimI 
the words of the will on her aid^ 
and Mr. Hickman's interest inhei 
view; her daughter havine ettidi 
that she would wear -* *— 
six months at least. Bi.._ ..._ 
young lady carried her poiiit — ' 
"Strange, said she, "if I, wlia 
shall mourn the heavy, the ii»- 
parable loss to the last hour oimf- 
life, should not shew mjoancfflll 
to the world for a few montliB!" 

Mr. Hickman, for his part, w 
so far from uttering an opjHMing 
word on this occasion, thatontha 
veiy day that Mias Howe put 0» 
her.i, he waited on her in A now 
suit of mourning, as for a near ttt' 
laKon. Hia servants and eqnP 
page made the same respeetfOl 
.a^eanmee. 



Whether tlie mother wascou-, 
Hulted by him iu it, I cannot say:

tX him with surprise, and asked 
I him, for whom he monmed ? I

[Urn, Sal. Sept. 30. 

I LiTTLB thought I ever could 
have owed ao much obligation t« 
aay man, aa you have laid me 
under. Anil yet what you have 
iteat me has almost broken my 
heart, and ruined my eyes. 

I am Burpriscd, though agree- 
ably, tbat you have bo eoou and 
so well got over that part of the 
tnistyou have engaged in, which 
relates to the family. 

It may be presumed, from the 
exits you mention of two of the 
iufemal man's accomplices, that 
the thunderbolt will not stop 
short of the principal. Indeed 1 
have some pleasure to think it 
soems rolling along towards the 
devoted head that has plotted ajl 
the mischief. But let me, how- 
ever, say, that although 1 think 
Mr. Mordcn not altogether in the 
wrong in hia reasons for reaent- 
ment, as he is the dear creature's 
kinsman and trustee; yet I think 
you very much in the right in 
endeavouring to disauade him 
from it. as you are her OKecutor, 
and act iu pursuance of her 
earnest request. 

But what a letter is that of the 
infernal man I I cannot observe 
upon it. Neither caul, for very 
different reasons, upon my dear 
creature's posthumous letters : 



pei'fections died, when my Clarissa 
drew her last breath! 
If decency be observed in hia 



letters; for I have not yet hod 
patience to read above two or 
three of them {besides this horrid 
one, which I return you inclosed); 
I may some time heace be curious 
to look, by llieir means, into the 
heartsof wretches, which, though 
Uioy must be the abhorrence of 
virtnouB minds, will, when laid 
open , (aa 1 presume they are in 
them) SkSoid a, prap^r foaming to 
those who read them , and teach 
them to detest men of such pro- 
fligate cliaracters. 

If your reformation be aincere, 
you will not be offended that I do

— And thus have I helped you to 
a criterion to try yourself by. 

By this letter of the wicked 
man it is apparent , that there are 
still wickeder women. But see 
what a guilty commerce with the 
devila of your sex will bring those 
to, whoaemoralsyehaveruined! 

— For those women were once 
innocent; it was man that made 
them otherwise. The first bad 
man, perhaps, threw them upon 
worse men: those upon still 
worse; till they commenced de- 
vils incarnate — the height of 
mickednena or ofuhwiie, is mil ar- 
rioed at all at once, as I have some- 
where heard observed.

wanting to be thought above 
hypocrisy and flattery , fall into 
rOBticitj, if not ill manners; a 
common fault with such, who, 
iiot caring to correct conBtilu- 
tional failmgs , aeek to gloas them 
over by some nomiViui virtue; 
when afl the time , perhaps , these 
failings are entirely owing to 
native arrogance ; or , at least , to 
a contracted rust, that they will

and, by what 1 am going to write, 
you will iiad me still more free: 
and yet I am aware, that such of 
my sex as will not assume some 
little dignity, and exact respect 
from yours, will render themselves 
cheap; and perhapH, for their 
modesty and diffidence , be repaid 
with scorn and insult. 

Ent the scorn I will endeavour 
not to deserve; and the insult 1 
will not benr.

fession of more than it imports ; to 
wit, "That I am haughty, un-

Ounk I aught la marry at all! 

If I marry either a sordid or im-

Long did I stand out against 
all the offers made me, and against 
all the pcrsnaaions of my mother; 
and, to tell you the truth, the 
longer, and with the mare ob- 
stinacy, as the person my choice 
would have first fallen upon, nas 
neither approved by my mother, 
nor by my dear friend. This 
rivetted me to my pride , and to 
my opposition; for a! though I was 
convmced, after awhile, that my 
choice would neither have been 
prudent or happy; and that the 
specious wretch was not what he 
had made mc believe he was; yet 
could I not easily think of any 
other man: and indeed, from the 
detection of liiin, took a settled 
Hversioii to the whole sex.

LETTER CLXV. 



Lundon, Tuesday nighl, Ool. 3. 

I OBGi your lordship's commands 
with great pleasure. 

Yesterday in the afternoon Mr. 
Lovelace made me a visit at my 
lodgings. As I woa in expectation 
of one from Colonel Morden abont 
the same time, 1 thought proper 
to carry him to a tavern which 
neitherof us frequented, (on pre- 
tence of an half- appointment) 
ordering notice to be sent me 
thither, if the colonel came: and 
Mr. Lovelace sent to Mowbray! 
and Touryille , and Mr. Doleman,

our three old coiripamons , audfti 
nephew of Mr. Doleman's (whoT 
had a good while been desirous to 
pass an hour with Mr. Lovelace) 
it blew ofl' for the present. J 

Mr, Mowbray and Mr. Tonrville 
had also taken some exceptions "^ 
the freedom of iny_pen; aud 1 
Lovelace, after his way, tod 
upon him to reconcile us ; and " 
it at the expense of all three j : 
with such an infinite run of bumoin 
andraillery, that we had nothiiu 
to do but to laugb at what be saio 
and at one another. I can deil 
tolerably with him at my pen ; l. _ 
is conversation he has no equftt 
In short, it was his day. He w — 
glad, he said, to find himu 
alive; and his two friends, clu 
ping and rubbins their haua 
twenty times in an hour, declared 
that now once more he was sJI

the world; aud they would folloll 
him to the farthest part of t*""

' gay hour, imnnnmun. We 

EwBtch every turn of such a. one's 

Baountenance , and arereBolvedto 

nlangb nhen he amiles, even before 

lifceuttcTB what we are expecting to 

ESon from his lips. 

■• Mr. Doleman and his nephew 

I'took leave of us by twelve. Mnw- 

M'iiiiLji and Tourville grew very 

V'BOisy by one : and were carried on 

by two. Wme never moves Mr. 

Lovelace, not with standing a vi. 

vacity which generally hSpa on 

over-gay spirita. As to myself, 

the little part I had taken in their 

gaiety, kept me unconcerned. 

The clock struck three before 
could get him into any serioua o 
attentive way — bo natural to him 
ia gaiety of heart; and such strong 
hold had the liveliuess of the even 
ing taken of him. His conversa' 
tion, you know, my lord, when 
his heart is free, runs off to the 
bottom without any dregs. 

But after that hour, and when 
weUiought of parting, he became 
a little more serious: and then he 
told me his designs, and gave 
aplanof his intended tour; wish- 
ing heartily, that I could have 
accompanied him. 

We parted about four; he not 
a, little dissntiEfied with me; for 
we had some talk about subjects, 
which, he said, he loved not tc 
think of; to wit. Miss Harlowe'f 
will; my eiecntorship; papers 1 
had in confidence communicated

1 etters he had written to me ^ from 
the time that he had made his first 
addresses to her. 

again , he 
eaid; and it would be upon veiy 
ill terms if I complied not with bis 
request Which 1 bid him not 
expect. But, that I might not 
deny him every thing, I told him, 
that I would give bim a copy of 
the will; though I was sure, I 
said, when ho read it, he would 
wish he had never seen it. 

I had ft message from him about 
eleven this morning, desiring me 
to name a place at which to dino 
with him, and Mowbray, and 
Tourville, for the last time; and 
anon after another from Colonel 
Murden, inviting me to pass the 
evening with him at the Bedford 
Head in Covent Garden. And, 
thatlmigbt keep them at distance 
from one another, I appointed 
Mr. Lovelace at the Eagle in Suf- 
folk Street. 

There I met him, and the two 
others. We began where we left 
olFat our last parting; and were 
vei7 high with each other. But, 
at Inst, all was made up, and he 
offered to forget and to forgive 
every thing, ou condition that I 
would correspond with him while 
abroad, and continue the series 
which had been broken through 
by his illness; and particularly 
give him, as I had offered, a copy 
of the lady's will. 

I promised him; and he then 
fell lo rallying me on my gravity, 
and on my tef<¥n&*!i.\sitt wSasssoafc^ii

as he called them. As we walked 
about the room , pipecting di 
to be brought in, be laid his hand 
npon m^ Bboulder; then pushed 
me from him with a curse : walking 
round me, and surveying itie from 
head to foot; then calling for tbc 
observation of the othei-s, he 
turned round upon bis heel, and 
with one of his peculiar wild airs, 
"Ha, ha, ba, bal" burst he out, 
" that these scur-1'aced proselytes 
should take it into their heads 
that they cannot be pious, with- 
out forfeiting both their good na- 
ture and good maunersl — Why, 
Jack," tiu:ning me about , "pr'y-

benign proof of the observation?

however, I told him not of,) : 
turned the scale ; and he agrea 
upon setting out to-morrow mi —

Belford, thou hast a confounded 

1 parcel of briars and thorns to

features!"

count , in answer to your desire to 
know, if 1 think him the man be

balancing whether he 
should set out the next morning, 
' ir the morning after. But finding 
' ' lofbing to do, and Col. 



against him, he oaght to leavj 
the kingdom till he had thiowa 
himself in their way. 

Mowbray gave his opinion. tliH 
be ought to leave it like a man i 
honour as he was; and if he d 
not take those genClemen to taa 
for their opprobrious speeches 
that at least he should be seen bl 
tliein iu public before he w^ 
away; <lse theymightgive thnn- 
selves aire, as if he had \e& tb< 
kingdom in fear of them. 

1 o this he himself so mucli iiti 
clined, that it was with ditHcultyl 
p ersuaded him,that as they had oei- 
i.her of them proceeded to n direct 
aadformal challenge; as they knew 
he hud not made himself difficDtt 
of access ; and as he had already 
done the family injury enooghi, 
and it was Miss Harlowo's eankest 
desire, that he would be content 
with that; he had no reason, from: 
any point of honour, to delay hia 
journey; especially as he lijt4 ~~ 



S! 



just a motive for hin going, aatlie 
estabtiahingof his heutth; and fia 
he might return the aoouer, if he 
saw occasion for it. 

I found the colonel in a very 
■olemnwaj. We had a good de&l 
of ducourae upon the subject of 
certain letters nhieh had passed 
between us in relation to Miss 
'Harlowe's will , and to her family. 
'He has some accouuta to settle 

ithhis baoker; which, he aaya, 
..ill be adjusted to-morrow; and 
ioa Thursday he proposes to go 
dtyn again, to take leave of his 
friends; and then intends to set 
oat directly for Italy. 

I wish Mr. Lovelace could 
have been prevailed upon to take 
any other tour, than that of 
France and Italy. 1 did propose 
Madrid to him; but he lauL'hed at 
me, and told me, that the pro- 
posat was in character from a 
muk; and from one who was be- 

>me as grave aa a Spaniard of 

[6 old cut, at iimeiy. 

I expresaed to the. colonel mv 
apprehensions, that hia cOuaina 
^ing injunctions would not liave 
ne force upon him that wore to be 
wished. 

"They have gnat forrn upon 
me, Mr. Belford," said he: "or 
one iPorW would not have held Mr. 
Xiovelace and me thus long. But 
liny intention is to go to Florence ; 
'BOt to lay my houea there, aa upon

He would have engaged me for

have, besides my advice and as- 
Bistanec, the adviceof oneof the 
most sensible ladies in England.] 

He took my hand, seeing me 
under some surprise: You must 
not hesitate, much less deny me, 



429 

Mr. Belford. Indeed you must 
not. Two things 1 will assure you 
of: thatlhave, aslhope, made 
every thing so clear that you can- 
not have any litigation: and that 
I have done BO justly, andl hope 
it will he thought so geaerously, 
hy all my relations, that a minil 
like yours will rather have plea- 
Btu'e than pain in the eseeution of 
this trust And this is what I 
think every honest man, who 
hopes to find an honest man for ' 
his executor, should do. 

1 told him, that I was greatly 
obliged to him for hia good opinion 
of ine : that it was so much every 
man's dull/ to be au honest man, 
that it could not be interpreted as 
vanity to say, that 1 had no doubt 
to be found so. But if I accepted 
of this trust, it must be on con- 
dition — 

I could name no condition, he 
saidf, interrupting me, which he 
would refuse to comply with. 

This condition, 1 told him, was, 
that as there was as great a pro- 
bability of bis being tny survivor, 
as I hia, be would permit me to 
name Mm for mine; and, in that 
case, a week should not pass be- 
fore 1 made my will. 

With all his heart, be said; and 
the readier, as ho had no ap- 



ed was really the effect of the 
tisfaction he had taken in the part 
I had already acted as his cousin's 
executor; and in my ability, he 
was pleased to add: as well as in 
jrarsuanee of his cousin's advice 
in the preaiiil>l«tftViBt^t*ii,Ms-*&-,

'^That this was a work which 
should be set about in full health, 
both of body and mind." 

I told him, that I was pleased to 
hear him say, that he was not in 
any apprehension of suddenly 
dyin^ ; as this gave me assurance 
that ne had laid aside all thoughts 
of actinj^ contrary to the dying re- 
quest of his beloved cousin. 

Does it argue, said he, smiling, 
that if I were to pursue a venge- 
ance so justifiable in my own 
opinion, I must be in apprehension 
of falling by Mr. Lovelace's hand ? 
— I will assure you, that I have no 
fears of that sort — but I know 
this is an ungrateful subject to 
you : Mr. Lovelace is your Mend ; 
and I will allow , that a good man 
may have a friendship for a lad 
one, so far as to wisn him well, 
without countenancing him in his 
evil. 

I will assure you, added he, that 
I have not yet made any resolu- 
tions either way. I have told you 
what force my cousin's repeated 
requests have with me. Hitherto 
they have withheld me — but let 
us quit this subject. 

This, sir, [giving me a sealed-up 
parcel] is my will. It is witnessed. 
I made no doubt of prevailing 
upon you to do me the requested 
favour. I have a duplicate to 
leave with the other gentleman; 
and an attested copy, which I 
shall deposit at my banker's. At 
my return , which will be in six or 
eight months at farthest, I will 
allow you to make an exchange of

God ijrotect you, Mr. Belford! 
You will soon hear of me again. 

He then very solemnty em- 
braced me, as I did him: and we 
parted. 

I heartily congratulate jour 
lordship on the narrow escape 
each gentleman has had from the 
other: for I apprehend, that they 
could not have met without fatal 
consequences. 

Time, I hope, which subdues all 
things, will subdue their resent- 
ments.

Several other letters passed between 
Miss Howe and Mr, Belford, re- 
lating to the disposition of the 
papers and letters; to the Poor's 
Fund; and to other articles of the 
lady's will: wherein the method of 
proceeding in each case was ad- 
justed. After which the papers 
were returned to Mr. Belford, that 
he might order the two directed co- 
pies of them to be taken. 

In one of these letters Mr. Belford 
requests Miss Howe to give the 
character of the friend she so 
dearly loved: "a task, he im- 
agines, that will be as agree- 
able to herself as worthy of her 
pen.

age, this admirable lady be- 
came mistress of such extra- 
ordinary and such various qua- 
lifications."

you will be able to collect from

Morden'a letters to you, particu- 
larly that of Sept. 23;** and from 
tbe letters of the detestable wretch 
himself, who, I find, hiie done her 
justice, although to his own con- 
demnation: all these together will 
enable i/ou, who seem to be f<o 
great au admirer of her virtues, to 
[•perform tbe task; and, I think,' 
HMtter than any person I know.

Etttlmake it my request, that if 
you do any thing in this way , you 
will let me see It. Iflfindituot 
to my mind, I will add ordiminish, 
as justice shall require. 

She was a wonderful creature 
from ber mfancf/; but I suppose 
you intend to give a character of 
her at those years when she was 
qualified to beau example toother 
young ladies, rather than a history 
of her life. 

I'erhapa, nevertheless, you will 
choose to give a description of her 
person: and aa you knew not the 
dear creature when ber heart was 
easy, Iwill tell you whatyet, in 
part, you can confirm ; 

That her shape was so fine , her 
proportiou ao exact, her featurea 
BO regular, ber complexion so 
lovely, and her whole person and 
mannersodistinguisbingly charm- 
ing, that she could not move with- 
out being admired and followed by 
the eyes of every one, though 
Htrangera, who never aaw her be- 
fore. Col. Morden's letter, above 
referred to, will confirm this. 

In ber dresa she was elegant be- 
yond imitation; and generally 
led the fashion to all ^e^Iadlea 
round her, without seeming to 
intend it, and without being proud 
of doing BO.* 

She was rather tall than of a 
middhng stature; and had a 
dignity in her aspect and air , that 
bespoke the mind that animated 
every feature.

appearance, to impute pride to j "In the general scale of beings, 
her. But these were such as knew I the lowest is as useful, and as much 
that they should have been proud a link of the great chain, as the 



of any one of her perfections: 
judging therefore by their own 
narrowness, they thought it im- 
possible that the lady who pos- 
sessed so many, should not think 
herself superior to them all. In- 
deed, I have heard her noble 
aspect found fault with , as indi- 
cating pride and superiority. But 
people awed and controlled, 
though butby their o wnconscious- 
ness of inferiority, will find fault, 
right or wrong, with those, of 
whose rectitude of mind and man- 
ners their own culpable hearts ^ive 
them to be afraid. But, in the bad 
sense of the word. Miss Clarissa 
Harlowe knew not what pride 
was. 

You may, if you touch upon this 
subject, throw in these sentences 
of hers , spoken at different times, 
and on different occasions. 

"Persons of accidental or 
shadowy merit, may be proud: 
but inborn worth must be always 
as much above conceit as arro- 
gance." 

**Who can be better, or more 
worthy, than they should be ? And, 
who shall be proud of talents they 
give not to themselves?" 

"The darkest and most con- 
temptible ignorance is that of not 
knowing one's self; and that all 
we have, and all we excel in, is the 
gift of God." 

"AJi human excellence is but 



comparative — there axo per^oivax^'^^si^^^^^'^^- 



highest." 

"The grace that makes every 
other grace amiable, is humqjtt. ' 

"There is but one pride pardon- 
able ; that of being above doing a 
base or dishonourable action.** 

Such were the sentiments by 
which this admirable young lady 
endeavoured to conduct herself, 
and to regulate her conduct to 
others. 

And in truth , never were affa- 
bility and complacency (gracma- 
ness, some have called it) more 
eminent in any person, man or 
woman, than in her, to those i^ 
put it in her power to oblige them: 
insomuch that the benefited has 
sometimes not known which to 
prefer; the grace bestowed, or the 
manner in which it was conferred. 

It has been observed, that what 
was said of Henry IV. of France, 
might be said of her manner of re- 
fusing a request; that she gener- 
ally sent from her presence the 
person refused, nearly as well 
satisfied as if she had nranted it 

Then she had such a sacred 
regard to truth — you cannot, sir, 
expatiate too much upon this 
topic. I dare say , that in all her 
letters , in all the letters of tiie 
wi'ctch , her veracity will not once 
be found impeachable, although 
her calamities were so heavy, toe 
horrid man's vriles so subtle, and 
her struggles to free herself from 



llcr cbiirity wis ao great, tbat 
ahe alimys chose to defciiil or

gave occasiou for it; and wlicn, 
y blamiug each otiiGr, we iu- 
tended a ;/etieral reprehension, 
which, as she used to say, it would 
appear arrogant or assuming to 
level more p-itper/i/] let me be Miss 
Fanny DarUugton. Then remov- 
ing out of the eirclc, and standing 
up, — Here I stand , unworthy oT

pany, till I have cleared myaelf. 
Ana now, suppose me to be her, 
let me hear your charge, a:id du 
i/im hear wliat the poor culprit can 
say to it in her own defeuce. And 
then answering the cnn/c'fura/aud 
iifip-oDKd circumstances by circum- 
stances as fairly to be supposed 
favourable, she brought off tri- 
umphantiy theceusuredlady; and 
to much to every one's satisfaction, 
that she was led to her chair, and 
voted a double rank in the circle, 
— as the re-instated Miss Fanny 
Durliogton, and as Miss Clarissa' 



iUiOwn. -133 

Very few persons , she used to 
say, would be condemned, or even 
accused, in the circles of ladies, 
were they present; it is gonerouH 
therefore, nay, it is but just, said 
ihe,to take the port of theubsuat, 
if not flagrantly culpable. 

But though icix'hm was ber 

■iliritjhi, as I may say, yet she 
had not lived years enough to pre- 
tend to so much experience, as to 
exempt her from the necessity oi' 
sometimes altering her opinion 
both of persona and things: but, 
when she foundherself obliged to 
do this, she took care, that llic 
particular instance of mistaken 
worthiness in the person should 
not narrow or contract her almost 
universal charity into generul 
doubt or jealousy. Au instance 
of what 1 mean, Qceors to oiy

she naed to Ba,y, "next in degree 
to that of having avoided error, 
frankly to own an error. And that 
the offering at an excuse in a 
blameable manner, was the un- 
doubted mark of a disingenuous, 
if not of aperrerse mind. 

Uut 1 oughtto add, on this head 
[of her great charity where char- 
acter was concerned , and where 
tliere was Toom for charity] that 
she was always deservedly severe 
in her reprehensions of a wilful 
and ftiiitiai vilenees. How conld 
she then forgive the wretch by

You must every where insist

the stupid persecutions of her re-

for improvement, as amusement:

thing to the other, but in want of

seek to deprive us, lest we should 
surpass them asmuchinwhat they 
chiefly value themselveB upon, aa 
we do in all the graces of a fine 
imagination, coiud never agree 
with her in Ihut. And yet 1 was 
entirely of her opinion, that those 
women who were Bolicitous to ob- 
tain that knowledge or leaniing, 
which they HUppoaed would add to 
their significance in sensible com- 
pany, and in their attainment of it 
imagined themselves above all 
domestic UBefulnc^, deservedly 
incurred the contempt which they 
hardly ever failed to meet with. 

Perhaps you will not think it 
amiss fiirther to observe on tli ' 
liead, as it will shew that VJr^'L't 
and iwiiHptfi always wont hand 
hand with her, that her dairy at 
her grandfather's was the delight 
of every one who saw it; and she 
of all who saw her in it. 

Her grandfather, in honour of 
her dexterity and ofher skill in all 
the parts of Uie dairy manage- 
ment, as well as of the elegance of 
the offices allotted for that use, 
would have hie scat, before known 
by the name of ilw Gno-a, to be 



called the Diiiry-liii'ii^c^. She had 
an easy, con veui cat, and graceful 
habit made on purpose, which she 
pat on when she employed herself 
in these works; and it was noted 
of her, that in llm name, hiur tiat 
she appeared t.o be amost elegant 
dairy-maid, she was, when called 
to a change of dreaa, the finest 
lady that ever graeed a circle. 

Her grandfather, father, mo- 
ther, uncles, aunt, and oven her 
brother and sister, made her Ire- 
(juent visits there, and were de- 
lighted with her silent ease, and 
unafiected behaviourinhcr works ; 
for she always out of modesty 
chose rather the operalive than the 
lUrcdh'e part that she might not 
discourage the servant whose 
proper business it was. 

Each was fond of taking a re- 
gale from her hands in her Diutji- 
hoiifif. Her mother and aunt 
Hervey generally admired her in 
silence, that they might notgive 
uneasiness to her sister; a spite- 
ful, perverse, uuimitatiug thing, 
who usually looked upon her dl 
the time with spoeonless envy. 
Now and then, however, the pout- 
ing creature would suffer extorted 
and sparing praise to burst open 
her lips; Uiough looking at the 
same time like Saul meditating^ 
the pointed javelin at the heart of 
David, the glory of bis kingdom. 
And now, metliinks, I see my 

igel-^end (too superior to take 
notice of her gloom) courting her 
acceptance of the milk-white 
curd, from hands more pure than

Beem to be the only excellence of 
her innnmeralile ones, which she 
owed to her family; whose iif 
rowneBB, immenaelj rich, and ii 
ineusely carking, put them upon 
iadulging lier in the turn she took 
to this part of knowledge: 
her eltfer aiater affected dress 
without being gracefulinit; aod 
the fine lady, which she could 
never be; and which her sister 
was without studying for it, or 
seeming to know she was so. 

It was usual with the one sister, 
when company was eipectedj to 
be half the morning dressmg; 
while the other would give direc- 
tions for the whole business and 
entertainment of the day, and 
then go up to her dressing-room, 
and, before she could be well 
missed, [haumgallherlMrigs

ceive company, and with all that 
graceful ease and tranquillity as if 
she had had nothing cue to think 
of. 

Long after her [hours perhaps of 
previous preparation having pass- 
ed] down would come rustling and 
buutling the tawdry and awkward

When very young, I was guilty

of it, at the firatot our happy inti-

the foUowing correctives , oe- 
castonally, yet privately enforced.

Ag^n, "You must convince ua,

you, not only of present, but of 
future imporluaity." — An indul- 
gence, however, let me add, that 
oui tolerable siasera do not always

Again, "I know you will favour

And I once pleading a cold, the

to be entreated — "Sing however,

tiea; whose whole time, in the 
short days tbcy generally make, 
and in the inverted night aiid day, 
where they make them longer, is 
wholly spent in dress , visits, 
cards, playa, operas, and musical 
entertainmeiitB, woDder at what I 
have written, and shall further 
write: and let them look upon it 
as an incredihle thing, that when, 
at a mature age, thcj cannot 
boast one of her perfections, there 
should have been a lady so young, 
who had 30 many. 

These must be such as know not 
how she employed her time; and 
cannot form tlio leaat idea of what 
may be done in those hours in 
which they Ue ejiFntoped milh tie 
aharks of dcaOi , as she used to call 

But before I come to mention 
the distribution she usually made 
of her lime, let me aay a fewworda 
upon another subject , in which 
she eiicelled all the young ladies 1 
ever knew. 

This was her skill in almost all 

L BortE of fine needleworks .- of 

[ which, however, I shall say the 

less since possibly you will find it 

mentioned in some of the letters. 

That piece which she bequeaths 
to her cousin Morden, is indeed 
a capital piece; a performance 
so admirable , that that gien- 
tlGman'siather,whoresidodchiQfly 
abroad , (was, as is mentioned in 
her will,) very desirous to obtain 
it, in order to carry it to Italy with 
him , to shew the curious of nther 
countries, (as he used to say) for 
the honour of Ui nicn, that the 
cloistered confinement was not 



ssary to inakeEnglish womnn 
excel in any of tlioHO fine arts 
upon which nuns and recluses 
value themselves. 

ller quickness at these sorts of 
works was astonishing; and a 
great encouragement to herself to 
prosecute them. 

Mr. Morden's father would have 
been continually making* her 
presents would shehave permitted 
him to do bo; and he used to call 
them, and so did her grandfather, 
tributes due to a merit so Bove- 



complishments and aoi|iiirements 
she was mistress of, will show what 
they must have been. She was far 
from being fond of rrtrHs, the 
fashionable foible of modem 
ladies: nor, aa will be easily per- 
ceived from what I have said , and 
from what I shall further 
aay, had she much time for play. 
She never therefore promoted 
their being called for; and often 
insensibly diverted the company 
from tlimn , by starting some 
entertaining subject, when she 
could do it without incurring the 
imputation of particularity. 

Indeed very few of her intimates 
would propose cards, if they could 
engage her to read, to talk, to 
touch the keys, or to sing, when 
any new hook, or new piece of 
music, came down. But when com- 
pany was so numerous, that con- 
versation could not take that 
agreeable turn which it oftenest 
does among four or five friends of 
like years and inclinations, and it 
became in a manner oeeewAri^ 



142 

detach off aorae of it, to make the 
rest better company, she would 
not refuse to pluj, if, upon cast- 
ing-in, it fell to her lot. Asd then 
she siiewed that her dis-reliah to 
cards was the effect of choice 
ontj; and that she was an ea,sy 
mistress of every genteel game 
played with them. But then she 
Silways declared against playing 
high. "Except for trifles," she 
used to say, "she would not sab- 
tnit to oAanoe what she was already 
iure of." 

At other times, "She would 
make her friends a very ill compli- 
ment, "shesaid, "if sho supposed 
they would wish to be possessed 
of what of riclit belonged to her ; 
and she should be very unworthy 
if she desired to make herself a 
title to what was theirs." 

"High gaming, in short," she 
■used to say, "was a sordid vice; 
lu immorality ; the child of 
avaric«; and a direct breacli of 
that commandment, which forbids 
I to covet what is our neigh- 
She was exeeedingly charit- 
able; the only one of her family 
that knew the mcauiog of the 
word: and this with regard both 
to the Bouls and the bodies of 
those who were the well-chosen 
objects of her benevolence. She 
kept a list of these, whom she 
used to call Aerpuor, entering one 
upon it as another was provided 
for, hy death or any oi 
but always made a reser 
tbeless, for unforeseen casea , aaiA

dent distribution of them, she had 
neither example nor equal. 

The aged, the blind, the lame, the 
widow, the orphan, the Dnsuccesa- 
ful industrious, were particularlj' 
the objects of it; ana the contn- 
butiug to the schooling of some, 
to the putting out to trades and 
husbandry the children of othere 
of the labouring or needy poor, 
and setting them forwara at the 
expiration of their servitude, were 
her great delights; as was the 
giving eood books to others; and, 
when she had opportunity , the 
instructing the poorer sort of her 
honest neighbours, and father's 
tenants, in the use of them. "That 
charity," she used to say, "which 

' viduB toT the 7H0 rain, aswellai 
the bodily u-mils of the poor, 
gives adouble benefit to theptWir, 
as it adds to the number of tho 
^o^/u^, what it takes from thai ol' 
the VTojUgate. And can there bp, 
in the eyes of that God, she was 
wont to say, who requires nothing 
so much from us as acts of bene- 
ficence to one another, a charity 
more worthy?" 

Her nnele Antony, when be 
came to settle in England, with 
bis vast fortune obtained in Ihc 
Indies, used to say, "This girl by 
her charities will bring down a 
blessing upon us all." Anditniual 
be owned they trusted pretty 
much on this presumption. 

But I need not say more on this 
head; nor perhaps wits it neces- 
sary to say so much; since the

In all her readings, and in her 
conversations upon them, she was 
fonder of finding beauties than 
biemiBhes, and chose to applaud 
both authors and books, where 
shecontdfindthe least room for it. 
Vet she used to lament, that cer- 
tain writers of the first class, who 
were capable of exalting virtue, 
and of putting vice out of coun- 
tenance, too generally employed 
themselves in works of imagina- 
lion only, upon subjects mertlij 
spei^daiwe, dtsmieTesling, and i«i- 
edifying; from which no useful mo- 
ral iir example could be drawn. 

But she was a severe ceiiaurer 
of pieces oi a light or indecenl tam, 
which had a tendency to corrupt 
the morals of youth, to convey 
polluted images, or to wound 
religion, whether in itself, or 
through the sides of its professors, 
and thiswhoever were the authors, 
and how admirable soever the 
execution. She often pitied the 
celebrated Dr. Swift for so em- 
ploying his admirable pen, that a 
pure eye was afraid of looking 
mto his works, and a pure ear of 
hearing any thing quoted from 
them. "Such authors," shensed 
to say, "were not honest to their 
own talents, nor grateful to the 
God who gave them." Nor would 
she, on these occasions, admit 
their beauties as a palliation; on 
the contrary , she neld it as an 
aggravation of their crime, that 
they who are so capable of mend- 
in/; thi: heart, should in any places

eicellencies, she was forwarder to 
Iwar than ^jieoi'; and hence, no 
doubt, derived no small part of 
her improvement. 

Althongh she was well read in 
thcEogli^, French, and Italian 

fioet^, and had read the best trana- 
atioDsof the Latin Classics; jet 
neldom did she quote or repeat 
from tb em, cither in her letters or 
eonversation, though exceedingly 
happy in a tenacious memory; 
principally through modesty, and 
to avoid the imjiutation of that 
affectoiion which I have Just men- 
tioned,

•a; he has beeu tljsciplined into 
greater improvement, than she 
nad made from the mere force of 
^uiuB and application. But it is 
demonatrabk to all who know 
how tomake observations on their 
acquaintance of both sexes, ar- 
rogant aa some are of their Buper* 
ficialitieb, that a lady at eightee 
take tho world through, is mo 
prndent and conversable than 
man at twentyfive. I can prove 
this by nineteen instances out of 
twenty in my onn knowledge. 
Yet how do these poor boasters 
value themselves upon the advan- 
tages their education gives them ! 
Wno has not seen some of them, 
just come from the university, dis- 
dsinfully smile at a mbtaken oi 
ill-pronounced moril from a lady, 
when her same has been clear, and 
herseutimentsjnst; and when he 
could not himaelf utter a, s' ' 
sentence fit to be repeated, . 
what he had borrowed from the 
authors he had been obliged to 
study, as a ^ainfol exercise to 
alow and creeping parts? But how 
'diRresE! 

Thie eicellcnt younc lady used 
) say, "it was incredible to think. 
hat might be done by ^urig 
rising, and by loni/ 'lin/s well filleil 
np." 

It may be added, that she cal- 
culated according to the practice 
ottuntHany, she had actually lived 
more years at sixteen, than l/iei/ 
had at Ifeenty-six. 

She was of opinion, "that no 
f one could sucnd their time pro- 
kjKrly, who did not live b^ acme 
""■lo; whodidnot approprialotlv 



hours, as near as might be, to par- 
ticular purposes and employ- 
ments." 

In conformity to this self-set 
lesson, the usual distributiou of 
the twenty-four houni, when left 
to her owu choice, was as fol- 

F„r REST she oUutted SlXhours 
only. 

She thought herself not so well, 
and so clear in her intellects, [so 
much alive, she used to say] ifsne 
exceeded this proportion. If she 
slept not, she chose to rise sooner. 
And in winter had her fire laid, 
and a taper ready burning to light 
it; not loving to give trouble to 
servants, ''whose harder work, 
and later hours of going to bed," 
she used to say, " required consi- 
deration." 

I have blamed her for her 
greater regard to them, than to 
herself. But this was her answer: 
" I have my choice : tp/m can wish 
for more? Why should I oppress 
others , to gratify myself? You 
sec what ^res-wffl enables one to 
do; white inij'osllioit would make 
" light burden heavy."

mily. This allotment she called 
her fund, upon which she used 
to draw, to satisfy her other de- 
bits: and in this she included 
visits received and returned, 
shows, spectacles, &c. which, in 
a country-life, not occurring eveij 
day, she used to think a great 
allowance, no less than tuyii days 
msir, for amusements only: and 
she was wont to say, that it waa 
hard if she could not steal time 
out of thisfund, for an excursion 
of even two or three days in a 
month, 

If it be s^d, that her relations, 
or the young neighbouring Isdie*. 
had but litlJe of her time, it will 
he considered, that besides these 
four hours in the twenty-fimr, 
great part of the time she was W- 



r 

■ , and it was a custom she had intro- 
K'duced among her acquaintance, 
[T tjiat the young ladies in their 
visits used frequently , in a. neigh- 
bourly way, (in the winter even- 
ings eBpeoiailj) to hring their 
work with them- and one of half a 
dozen of her aelect acqunintauce 
■nsed by turna to read to the rest 
»fia they were at work. 

This was her usual method 
I when at her own command for six 
days in the week. 

Tl>e SEVENTH DAY, 
She kept as it ought fo be kept: 
^^■nd as some part of it was fre- 
nquently employed in works of 
tnercy, the hoar she allotted to 
Visitmg the neighbouring poor 
^rns oceasionalty supplied iroin 
this day, and added to her fund. 

But I must obaerpe, that when 
n her grandfather's lifetime she 
nas three or four weeks at a time 
his housekeeper and guest, as 
also at either of her uncles , her 
UBual distribution of time was 
Tsried: hut still she had an eye 
to it as nearly as circumstances 
would admit. 

When I had the happiness of 
having her for my guest, for a 
■fortnight or so , she likewiBe dis- 

Sensed with her rulea , in mete in- 
ulgence to my foibles, and idler 
ihabits; for I also (thoagh I had

time; and can witness to the 
benefit I found by it in my health ; 
as also to the many useful things 
I waa enabled by that means wim 
eaae and pleasure to perform. 
And in her aeeount-book I have 
found thia memorandnra since her 
ever-to-be lamented death; — 
"From svch a ihiij to nurli a day, 
all holidays, at my dear Miss 
Howe's," At her return r "Account 
resumed, suek a iJai/ ," naraiugit; 
and then she proceeded regularly, 
as before. 

Once a week she used to reckon 
with herself; when, if within the 
144 hours, contained in the six 
days, she had made her account 
even , she noted it accordingly ; if 
otherwise she carried the debit 
to the neit week's account; as 
thus: debtor to ike article af bene- 
volent visits, so many hours. And 
so of the rest. 

But it was always an especial 
part of her care, that whether 
visiting or visited, she shewed in 
all companies an entire ease, 
satisfaction, and cheerfulness, as 
if she kept no such particular ac- 
count, and ns if she did not make 
herself answerable to herself for 
her occasional proceedings. 

This method, which to others 
wUl appear perplexing and un- 
necessary, her earli/ hours, and 
custom, had made pleasant and 

And indeed, as I used to tell 
her, greatly as 1 admired her in 
all her methods , I could not bring 
myself to this, might 1 have had 
the world for my reward.

So vana , yet ao cool a frii'Ttd 1 
So mach what I nisb to be, but 
never shall be! — For, alas! my 
stay , my adviser , my monitreBB, 
my directresB, is gone! for ever 
gone! She honoured me with the 
title of the sister of her heart: butl 
wiu only BO in the lore I bore her, 
(a love beyond a siater'a — in- 
finitely beyond her alBter's!) in 
the hatred I have to every mean 
and sordid aetioa ; and in my love 
of virtue: for otherwise, I am of 
a high and haughty temper, as 1 
have acknowledged heretofore. 
and very violent in my paaaions. 

In ehort, she was the nearest 
perfection of any creature 1 ever 
knew. She never preached to me 
lessons which she practised not 
herself. She lived the life she 
taught. All humility, meekness, 
self-accusing, others acquitting', 
though the shoifiiw of the fanit 
was nardly hers, the n<ibstance 
theirs, whose only honour was 
their relation to her. 

To lose such a friend, such a 
guide — if ever my violence was 
justifiable, it is upon thin recollec- 
tion! For Bhe only lived to make 
me sensible of failings, but not 
long enough to enable me to con- 
quer them; as I was resolved. to 
endeavour to do. 

Once more then let me execrate

again predominate! — And how

I can't bear to be threatened,

qnestioned, give himself airs in 
my absence, if 1 know it, that shall 
make me look mean in any body's 
eyes: that shall give my frienda

upon wishing me to change my in- 
tentions, ormyplan,to avoid him. 
Upon snch despicable terms as 
these , think you that I could bear 

Butwhy, if such were his pur- 

Kse, did he not let me know it 
fore I left England V Was he 
unable to work himself up to a 
reaolutjon, till lie knew me to be 
out of the kingdom? 

As soon as I can infoim myself 
where to direct to him, I will write 
to know his purpose: forleannot 
bear suspense m ench a case as 
this: that solemn act, were it even 
to be marriage or hanging, which 
must be done to-morrow, I had 



rather-^should be done to-day. My 
mind tires and sickens with impa- 
tience on ruminating upon scenes 
that can neither afford variety nor 
certainty. To dwell twenty days 
in expectation of an event that 
may be decided in a quarter of an 
hour, ia grievous. 
If hecometoParis, althoughl 



easily find out my liiili/iiiifs 
every day see some or other of my

all public places. And, on my

direction whither my letters fijom

time to time be forwarded. 

Werelsure, that his intention 
is what Joseph Leman tells me it 
is, I would stay hcrCj or ehoilen 
his course to me, let bim be where 
he would. 

I cannot get off my regrets on 
account of this dear lady for the 
blood of me. If the colonel and 
I are to meet, as he has done me 
no injury, and loves tho memory 
of his cousin , we shall engage 
with the same sentimenta, as to 
the object of our dispute; and 
that, you know, is no very eom- 

In short, I am as much con- 
vinced that I have done wrong, as 
he can be; andregi'et it as much.

by any man in the world, however

I CAMNUT think, my deiir Love- 
lace, that Colonel Morden has 
either threatened you in those 

froHS terms mentioned by the vile, 
ypocritioalj and ignorant Joseph 
Leman, or intends to follow you. 
They are the words of people of 
that fellow's class; and not of a, 
gentleman : not of Colonel Mor- 
den, I am sure. You'll observe, 
that Joseph pretends uot to aay 
that he heard him speak them. 

I have been vnry eolicitous to 
sound the colonel, for your sake, 
and for his own, find for the sake 
of the injunctions of the excellent 
ladj to me , as well us to him , on 
thatsubject. Heis (andvouwUl 
not wonder that he should be) es-

Once he said tome, that had his 
beloved cousin's case been that of 

dulity or weakness conti'ibuting 
to her fall; he could have forgiven 
you. But, in so many words, he 
assured me, that he had not taken 
any resolutions ; nor had he de- 
clared himself to the family is 
such a way as should bind hlin to

Let me therefore (and throusfa

Time will anbduo all things. No- 
body doubts your bravery. Nor 
will it he known, that your plan 
ia changed through persuasion. 

Young Harlowe talks of calling 
you to account. This is a plain 
evidence, that Mr. Morden has 
not taken the quiirrel upon him- 
self for their family.

and that he is as cool and sedate 
aa skilful. But vet 1 will add, 
that if I had a value for my Ufe, 
he should be the last man, eieept 
yourself, with whom I would 
choose to have a contention. 

I have, as you required, been 
very candid and sincere with you, 
I have not aimed at palliation. 
If ^ou seek not Colonel Morden, 
it IB my opinion he will not seek 
yoai for he is a man of principle. 
But if you seek him, I believe he 
irillnotshnnyou. 

Let mere-urge, |it is the effect

^Hod should not be again an iig-

so brave a man as the colonel 
should drop, were you and he to 
meet; and, on the other hand, it 
would be dreadful, that you 
should be sent to your account 
unprepared for it, and pursuing a 
fresh violence. Moreover, seest

thy principal agents, ihe hand

My zeal on this occasion may

I should have been very glad, 
thatyouhad thought Ibad jiunish-

the wroaea I have done to the 
moat eicel lent of women ; and that 
it had been possible for two per-

them. 

Now, sir, if what I have heard

in pursuance of his answer to my

been at Preshurg, and had in- 
tended to visit some other cities of

That I might not appei

for this city the vainest morning. 
I knew not but that tbe politeueEs 
of this court might have engaged, 
beyond his intention, a gentleman 
wlto has only his pleasure to pur- 

lut being disappointed in my 
hope of finding you here, it be- 
comesmc toacij^uaint you, that 1 
have such a desire to stand veil in 
theopinionofaman of your spirit, 
thai I cannot hesitate a moment 
upon the option, which lam sure 
Mr. Lovelace, in my situation, 
(thus called upon) would make. 

I own, sir, that I have, on all 
occasions, apoken of your treat- 
ment of my ever-dear cousin as it 
deserved. It would have been 
very surprising if I had not. And 
it behoves me (now youhave given 
me BO noble an opportunity of ex- 
plaining myself) to convince you, 
that no words fell from my lips, of 
you, merely because you were 
absent. I acquaint you, there- 
fore, that 1 will attend your ap- 
pointmcnt; and would, were it tc 
the farthest part of tbe globe. 

1 shall stay some days at this 
court; and if you please to direct

your commands will come safely

not know it, if she had not told me, 
that she could not be guilty of affec-

she intended to marry f* I knew, 
as she once upbraided me, that 
from the time I had got her from 
her father's house , 1 had a plain 
path before me.** True did she 
say, and I triumphed in the dis- 
covery, that from thBft time I had 
held her soul in suspense an hundred 
times.*** My ipecacuanha trial 
alone was enough to convince an 
infidel, that she had a mind in 
which love and tenderness would 
have presided, had I permitted 
the charming buds to put forth 
and blow.f

her cause of doubt, f f And did

Hr. LQVelaee to Jobs Belford, Esq. 
Trent, Dec. J-W. 

To-uoeaow ia to be the diy 

that will, in all probability, sena 
either one or two ghosts to attend 
themaneaof my Clabissa. 

1 arrived here yesterday; m3 
inquiring for an English gen- 
tleman of the name of Morden, 
soon found out the colonel'i 
lodgings. He had been in tewn 
two days; and left his name at 
every probable place. 

He was gone to ride out; and I 
left m'j name, and where to U 
found; and in the evening be 
made tne a visit. 

He was plaguy gloomy. Tb»t 
was not I. But yot he told m^ 
that I had acted like a man oi 
true spirit in my first letter; and 
with honour, in giving him to 
readily this meeting. He wished 
'^"^ in other respects; and than 
ight have seen ea(^ othfJ 
upon better terms than now <fi! 
did. 

I said, there was no recalliag

done, as well as he.

would be as eiasperatmg as on-

The two latter be yours, Mr. 

Morden. The time to-morrow, 

or next day, as jouplease. 

I Neitdsy, then, Mr.LoTelace; 

I ajid we'll ride out to-morrow, to 

fix the plaue. ; 

Agreed, sir. | 

Well; now, Mr. Lovelace, dO| 

you chooae the weapou. 

I said , I believed we might be 
upon equal foot with the single 
I rapier; but, if be thought other- 
wise, I bad no objection to a 

I I will only say , replied he , that 
, the chances may be more equal 
I by the sword, becauae we can 
I neither of us be to seek in that: 
and you would stand 



nritb 



pistol; and yet I have brought 
two, that you may take your 
choice of either: for, added be, 
I never missed a mark at pistol- 
distance, since I knew bow to 
bold a pistol. 

I told him, that he spoke like 
himself: that I was expert enough 
that way, to embrace it, if he 
chose it; though not so sure of 
my mark as he pretended to be. 
Yet the devil's irft, colonel, ifl, 
who have slit a bullet in two upon 
a, knife's edge, bit not my man. 
So I have no objection to a pistol, 
if it be i/uur choice. No man, 
I'll venture to say, has a steadier 
band or eye than I have. 

They may both be of use to 
you, sir, at the sword, as well as 
at the pistol: the aword therefore 
be the thing, if you please. 



With all my heart. 

We parted with a solemn sot 
of ceremonious civility: and thi 
day I called upon him; and wt 
rode out together to fii npon thi 
place: and both being of on< 
mind, and hating to put off foj 
the morrow what could be doni 
to-day. would have decided ii 
then: but Ue la Tour, and th< 
colonel's valet , who attended ns 
being unavoidably let into th( 
secret, joined to beg no would 
have with us a surgeon from 
Briien, whom La Tour had fallen 
in with there , and who bad told 
,him he was to ride next morning 
to bleed a person in a fever, at 
a lone cottage, which by the 
surgeon's description was not far 
from the place where we then 
were, if it were not that very 
cottage within sight of us. 

They undertook so to manage 
it, that the surgeon should know 
nothing of the matter till his 
assistance was called in. And 
La Tour being, as I assured the 
eolonel,a ready contriving fellow, 
[whom t ordered to obey him ai 
myself, were the chance to be in 
his favour] we both agreed to 
defer the decision till to-morrow, 
an{l to leave the whole about the 
surgeon to the management of 
our two valets; enjoining them 
absolute secrecy: and so rods 
back again by different ways. 

We fixed upon a little lone 
valley for the spot — Ten to- 
morrow morning the lime — and 
single rapier the word. Yet I re- 
peatedly told him, that I valued 
myself so much upon my skill in

_. After a few complimeats , both 
the gentlemen^ with the greatest 

ErBaeoce uf mind that ever I be- 
eldinineu, atript to their sliirta, 
anddren. 

They parried with equal judg- 
ment several passes. Mj clievalier 
drew the first blood, makiog a 
desperate push, which, by a sud- 
den torn of his aatagoniat, missed 
going clear through him, aod 
wounded bim ou the fleshj part of 
the ribs of his right side; which 
part the sword tore out, beine ou 
the extremity of the body: out, 
before my chevalier could recover 
himself, the colonel, in return, 
pushed hitu into the inside of 
the left arm, near the shoulder: 
and the sword (raking bis breast 
as it passed) being followed by a 
great effusion of blood, the colonel 
said, sir, I believe you have 
enough. 

My chevalier swore by G— d, 
he was not hurt; 'twas a pin's 
point: and bo made another pass 
athia antagouiat; whichhe, with 
a Burptiniiig dexterity, received 
under his arm, and run my dear 
chevalier into the body: who im- 
mediately fell; saying. The luck 
is yours , air — ^ O my beloved Cla- 
riaaa!^ Now art thou — inwardly 
he spoke three or fonr words more. 
His sword dropt from his hand. 
Mr. Morden threw his down, and 



Ah, 



saving in French — 

uri you are a dead 

— Call to Qfld for mercy ! 

We gave tlie signal agreed 

npon to the footmen; and they to 

the surgeons; who instantly came 

up. 



Colonel Morden, I found, was 
too well used to the bloody work; 
tor he was as cool as if nothing 
extraordinary had happened, aa. 
ctistiug the aurgeoua though his 
own wound bled much. But my 
dear chevalier fainted away two 
or three times running, and 
vomited blood besides. 

However, they stopped the 
bleeding for the preseut; and we 
helped him into the voiture : and 
thea the colonel suffered bis own 
wound to be dressed; andappeared 
concerned that my chevalier was 
between whiles (when he conld 
speak, and struggle) extremely 
outrageous. — Poor gentleman! 
he had made quite sure of tic- 

The colonel, against the lur- 
geons' advice, would mount on 
horseback to pass into the Vene- 
tian territories; and generously 1 
gave me a purse of gold to pay the 
surgeons; desiring me to make a 
present to the footman; and to 
accept of the remainder, aa a 
maik of his satisfaction in my con- 
duct, and iu my care and tender- 
ness of my master. 

The surgeons told him , that my 
chevalier could not live over the 

When the colonel took leave of 
him , Mr. Lovelace said , you 
have well revenged the dear crea- 

I have, sir, said Mr. Morden:

you called upon me to this work, 
while I was balaucing whether 
to obey, or disobey, the dear

be ye all witneaspfi, that I have 

provoked my destiny, a "

piety of a confessor , (wriui 
Mr, Lovelace's hand) snatch tl 
few Heeling motneuta, and c 
mendyonraclf to God. 

AndsD he rode off. 

The voiture proceeded slowly 
with my chevalier; yet the motion 
set both his wounds bleeding 
alresh; and it was with dilEculty 
they again stopped the blood. 

We brought him alive to 
nearest cottage; and he gave 
ders to me to dispatch to vou 
packet I herewith send sealed up ; 
and bid me write to you the parti- 
culars of thismost unhappy affair : 
and give you thanks , in his name, 
for all your favours and friendship

What remains to be mentioned 
for the satisfaction of aucb of the 
readers as may be presumed to 
have interested themselves iotbe 
fortunes of thoae other principals 
in the story, who Burvived Mr. 
Lovelace, will be found sum- 
marily related as follows : 

The news of Mr. Lotelacb's un- 
happy end waa received with as 
much grief by hia own relations, 
aa it was with esultation by the 
Harlowe family, and by 
Howe. Hia own family were 
to be pitied, because being sincere 
admirers of the inimttable lady, 
they were greatly grieved for the 
injustice done her; and now had 
the aiidiliimal mortification of 
losing the only raale of it, by a 
violent death.

haanotrecovered; nor is likely to 



a with, and 
title to assert, which admits of 
litigation; and he not blessed with 
so mnch patience as ia necessary 
to persons embarrassed in law. 

What is further observable in 
regard to him, is that the match 
was entirely of his own head, 
against the advice of his father, 
mother, and uncles, who warned 
biu of marrying in this lady a 
law-suit for life. His ungenerous 
behaviour to bis wife, for what she 
cannot help, and for what is aa 
much her misfortune as his, has oc- 
casioned such estrangements be- 
tween them (she being a woman 
of spirit) as, were bis law-suits 
determined, even more favour- 
ably than probably they will be, 
must make him unhappy to the 
end of bis life. He altributea all 
his misfortunes, when he opens 
himself to the few friends he has, 
to its vile and cruel trealmeni af his 
emijelio sister, fie confesses these 
misfortunes to be just without 
having temper to acquiesce in the 
acknowledged justice. One month 
in every year he puts on mourn- 
ing, and that month commences 
with him on the 7th of September, 
during which he shuts himself up 
from all company. Finally , he if

the subject, was as much a

She nBTBr was left out of any 
party of pleasure, after she haa 

Eassed her niuth year; and, ui 
□nour of her prattling vein was 
considered as a principal peisoti 
in the frequent treats and enter-

of luxurious living, ^ve with a 
view to encrease their acquaint- 
ance for the sake of their busi-

what made for their intereflt, 
would probably be a means to 

auiuken the appetites, and ruin

At fifteen or sixteen, she af- 
fected, both in dress and mauners, 
to ape such of the quality as were 
most apish. The richest silks in 
her father's shop were not too rich 
for her. At all public diversions 
she was the leader, instead of the 
led, of all her female kindred and 
acquaintance, though they were 
a third older than uerself. She 
would bustle herself into a place, 
and make room for her more 
bashful companions, through the 
trowuH of the first possessors, at 
a crowded theatre, leavtog every 
one near her amazed at her self- 
consequence, wondering she had 
no flervant to keep place for her;

Sbe ofliciously made herself of

interest on Aeir benefit-oicliti. 
She knew the chrisliaji, asw«lai 
aui-nanie of every pretty fellow 
who frequented public placa; 
and affected to speak of thembf

Those who had not obeyed ths 
call her eyes always made apoa 
nil of them for notice at her en-

seat, were spoken of with hangbti' 
ness, as, Jacks, or Toms; while

Shbours, they supposed their 
it concerned to go forward 
rather than backward in outward 
appearances. Thej flattered them- 
selves, and they flattered their 
girl, and she was ciiiirety of their 
opinion , that she had charms and 
wit enough to attract some man 
of rank; of furhme at least: and 
yet this daughter of a mercer-fa- 
ther and grocer-mother could not 
bear the thoughts of a creeping 
cit; encouraging herself with a 
few instances {comjiaralively few) 
which she had always in her head 
aa common ones, of girls much in- 
ferior to herself in station, talents, 
education , and even fortune , who 
had succeeded — as she doubted 
not to succeed. Handsome settle- 
ments, and a chariot, that temp- 
tine gewgaw to the vanity of the 
middUng ctasB of females, were 
the least that ahe proposed to 
herself. But all this while, neither 
her parentsnor herself considered, 
that she had appetites indulged 
to struggle with, and a turn of 
education given her, as well as a 
warm constitution, unguarded by 
sound principles, and uuhene- 
fitted by example, which made her 
much better qualified for a mis- 
tress than a wife. 

Her twentieth year , to her own 
equal wonder and regret, passed 
over her head, and she had not 
had one offer that her pride would 
permit her to accept. A ^rlfcnsi

tl) en beginning to bloaaom, will, 
ae a neir tbiog, attract the eyes 
of men: but if she make her mcp 
oheflp at public placee, she wiil 
find, thfttnna faces mlldrawmore 
ftttentioD than fne faces con- 
■tantlj seen. Policy, therefore, 
if nothing else were conaidered, 
iTould iudiice a young beauty, if 
she could tame her vanity , just to 
ahew herself, and to be talked of, 
and then withdrawing, as if from 
discretion (and discreet it will be 
to do so) eipect to be sought after, 
rather than to be thought to seek 
for; only reviving now and then 
the memory of herself at the 

Eublic places in turn, if she find 
erself likely to be forgotten; and 
then she will be new again. But 
this observation ongbt young la- 
dies always to have in their heads, 
that they can hardly ever expect 
to gratify their vanity, aad at the 
same time gain tlie admiration of 
men worthy of making partners 
for life. They may, in short, have 
many admirers at public places, 
but not one lover. 

Sally Martin knew nothing of 
this doctrine. Her beauty was in 
its bloom , and yet she found ber- 
eelf neglected. "Sally Martin, 
the mercer's daughter; she never 
failsbeinghere; was the answer, 
and the accompanying ohaerva- 
tion, made to every questioner, 
irbo is that lady? 

At last her destiny approached. 
It was at a masquerade that she 
first saw the gay, the handsome 
Lovelace, who was just returned 
from his travels. She wi 
idiately struek with his 



and with the brilliant things that 
she heard fall from his lips sa he 
happened to sit near her. He, 
who was not then looking oat for 
a wife, was taken vfith Sally's 
smartness, and with an air that 
at the same time shewed her to 
be equally genteel and self'signi' 
licant; and signs of approbation 
mutually passing, he found no 
difficnky in acquainting himself 
where to visit her next day. And 
yet it was some mortification to % 
person of her self-conseauence, 
and gay appearance, tosatimitto 
be known by BO fine a young gen- 
tleman as no more than a mercer's 
daughter. So natural ia it for a 
girl, brought up aa Sally was. to 
be occasionally ashamed of those 
whose folly had set her above her- 
■elf. 

But whatever it might be to 
ally, it was no disappointment to 
Mr.XiOTelace, to find his miatress 
higher degree ; because be 
hoped to reduce her soon to the 
lowest condition that an unhappy 
—Oman can fall into. 

But when Miss Martin had in- 
formed herself Uiat her lover was 
the nephew and presumptive heir 
of Lord M. she thought him the 
very man for whom ahe had been 
so long and so impatiently look- 
ing out; and for whom it was 
worth her while to spread ber 
l«ila. And here it may not be 
amiss to observe that it is reiy 
probable, that Mr. Lovelace had 
Sally Martin in his thoughts, and 
perhaps two or three more whose 
j hopes of marriage from him had 
I led them to their ruin, when he 



r

drew tie following whimsical 

Sicture, in a letter to hia friend 
elford , not inserted in the pie- 
eeding collection. 

"Methinka," aaya he, "I gees 
young couple in courtship, having 
leach a design upon the other: 
■Uie girl plavB off; ehe is very 
'fcappj, as the is: she cfinnot he 
happier: she will not change hei

pose , is one who does not confem 
tbalhe desires not that sheK*o(iMj 
abe holds ready a net under her 
apron; he another under hb coat; 
each intending to throw it over 
the other's neck; she over Lis, 
when her pride is gratified, and 
she thinks she can he sure of him ; 
he over hers, when the watched- 
for yielding moment has carried 
consent tuo far — and suppose he 
happens tji be the more dexterous 
of the two, and whips his net over 
her, before she can cost hers over 
himj how, I would fain know, can 
she be justly entitled to cry out. 
upon cruelty, barbarity, de- 
ception, aacrifices, and all the rest 
of the eiclamatorj' nonsense, with 
which the pretty fools in such a 
case, are wont to din the ears of 
their conquerors? Is it not just, 
tbiukest tliou, when she makes 
her appeals to gods and men, that 
hoth gods and men should laugh 
iftt her, and hitting her in the teeth 
'"rith her own felonious intentioaa, 
id her ait down patiently under 
^ier deserved disappointment?" 

In short, Sally's parents, as well 
as herself, encoui-aged Mr. Love- 
lace's visits. They thought they 
might uuat to a diBcretiou iu her 



475 

which she herself was too wise to 
douht. Pride they knew she had. 
And that, in these cases, is often 
called discretion. — Lord help the 
sex, saysLovelaue, if they had not 
pride! — Nor did they suapeot 
danger from that specious air of 
sincerity, and gentlenesB of man- 
ners, which he could assume or 
lay aside whenever he pleased. 

The second masquerade, which 
was no more than their third 
meeting abroad, completed her 
ruin, from so practised, though so 
young a deceiver i and that before 
she well knew she was in danger; 
for, having prevailed with her to 
go off with him about twelve 
o'clock to his aunt Forbes's, a 
idy of honour and fortune, to 

horn he had given reason to ex- 
pect her future niece [the only hint 
of marriage he ever gave herj , ha 
carried her to the bouse ot the 
wicked woman, who beajw the 

,me of Sinclair in these jiapers: 

id there, by promises, which she 
understood in the favourable 
sense (for where a woman loves, 
she seldom doubla enongh for her 
own safety) obtained an easy con- 
quest over a virtue that was little 

ore than nominal. 

He found it not difficult to in- 
duce her to proceed in the guilty 
commerce , till the effects of it be- 
came too apparent to be hid. Her 
parents then (in the first fury of 
lheirdisappoiutment,andveiation 
for being deprived of all hopes of 
such a son-in-law) turned her out 

Her disgrace thus published, 
she became hardened; and, pro-

B Touritemistreas she then was, she 
was 80 incensed against her 
parents for an iadigaity eo little

when repenting of their passionate

coming the favourite danghtw of 
her mother Sinclair, at the per- 
■nasions of that abandoned wo- 
man, she practised to faring on

though she was bo far gone, that 
it had like to have cost her her 
life.

fiding in, and daring woman; 
gbe ft creature of specious appear- 
ance and great art. 

A still viler wickedness, 
possible, remains to be told of 
SftUy Martin. 

Her father dying, her mother, 
in hopes to Tedai/a her, as she 
called it, proposed to her to quit 
, Uie bouseof the infamous Sinclair, 
to retire with her into the 



-_ jtry, where her disgrace, and 
her then wicked way oflife, wonid 
not be known; and there so to live 
avc appearancea; the only 
5he had ever taught her, 
besides that of endeavouring ra- 
ther to delude than be deluded. 

To this Sally consented; but 
with no other intention, aa she 
often owned (and gloried in it) 
than to cheat her mother of the 
greatest part of her substance, in 
revenge for consenting to mt 
being turned out of doors long be- 
fore , and by way of reprisal for 
having persuaded her fatlier, W 
she would have it, to cut her off, 
in his last will , ii-om any share in 
his fortune. 

This unnatural wickedness, in 
half a year's time, she brooght 
about; and then the serpent re- 
tired to ber obscene den withhei 
loila, laughing at what she had 
)ne; even after it had broken her 
mother's heart, as it did in a few 
months' time: a severe but juit 
punishment, for the unprincipled 
education she had given ber. 
". ought to be added, that tbti 
__ an iniquity, of which neither 
Mr. Lovelace, nor any of his 
friends, could bear to hear her 
boast; and always checked ber 
for it, whenever she did; con- 
demning it with one voice; and it 
is certain, that this and other in- 
stances of her complicated wicked- 
ness, turned early Lovelace's 
heart against her; and, b«d she 
not been subservient to him in bis 
other pursuits, he would not have 
enduredher: for,speakingof her, 
he would say, Let not any one re-

fice to the successful intriguer. 

The mdow herself, half-intoxi-

Bequences of which, in length of

(herown indiscretion not allon '

in high preferment , at last , witii 
Sally, was admitted a quarter ^art-

All that ia necessary to add to 
the history of these unhappy wo.

After the death of the profligale 
Sinclair, they kept on the in- 
famous trade with too much sac- 
cess ; till an accident happened in 
the house — a gentleman of family, 
killed in it in a fray, contending 
with another for a new-vampea 
face. Sally was accused of hold- 
ing the gcntlcmaa's arm, while 
his more favoured adverBary ran 
him through the heart, and then 
made off. And she being tried for 
her life, narrowly escaped. 

This accident obliged diem to 
break up house-keeping; andnot 
having been frugal enough of 
their lU-gotteii gains (laruhiog 
upon one, what they got fay an-

CONCLUSION. 



shall never fail while she lives. 
She has even engaged her mother 
to contribnte annually to it. And 
Mr. Hickman has appropriated 
twenty pounds a-jear to the same. 
In consideration of which she 
aUows hun to recommend four ob- 
jects yearly to partake of it. — 
Allows^ is her style; for she as- 
snmes the whole prerogative of 
dispensing this charify; the only 
prerogative she does or nas occasion 
to assume. In every other case, 
there is but one wiUbetween them ; 
and that is generally his or hers, as 
either speaks first, upon any sub- 
ject, be it what it will. Mrs. 
Hickman, she sometimes as plea- 
santly as generously tells him, 
must not quite forget that she was 
once Miss Howe, because if he 
had not loved her as such and with 
all her foibles, she had never been 
Mrs. Hickman. Nevertheless she 
seriously, on all occasions, and 
that to others , as well as to him- 
self, confesses, that she owes him 
unretumahle obligations for his 
patience wuh her in HER day, and 
for his generous behaviour to her 
in HIS. 

And still the more highly does 
she esteem and love him, as she 
reflects upon his past kindness to 
her beloved friend; and on that 
dear friend's good opinion of him. 
Nor is it less grateful to her, that 
the worthy man joins most 
sincerely with her in all those re- 
spectful and affectionate recollec- 
tions, which make the memory 
of the departed precious to sur- 
vivors. 



of humanity and affection, as to be 
unconcerned at the unhappy fate 
of his most intimatevfriend. Bat 
when he reflects upon the untimely 
ends of several of his companions, 
but just mentioned in the preced- 
ing history — on the shocking 
despondency and death of hispoor 
friend Belton — on the signal 
justice which overtook the wicked 
Tomlinson — on the dreadful exit 
of the infamous Sinclair — on the 
deep remorses of his more valued 
friend — and on the other hand, 
on the example set him by the most 
excellent of her sex — and on her 
blessed preparation, and happy 
departure — and when he con- 
siders , as he often does with awe 
and terror, that his wicked habits 
were so rooted in his depraved 
heart, that all these warnings^ and 
this lovely example, seemed to be 
hut necessary to enable him to 
subdue them , and to reform ; and 
that such awakening calls are 
hardly ever afforded to men of his 
cast, or (if they are) but seldom 
attended with such happy effects 
in the prime of youth, and in the 
full vigour of constitution : — when 
he reflects upon all these thinp, 
he adores the mercy, which 
through these calls has snatched 
him as a brand out of the fire: and 
thinks himself obliged to make it 
his endeavour to find out, and to 
reform, any of those who may have 
been endangered by his means; as 
well as to repair to the utmost of 
his power, any damage or mis- 
chiefs which he may have occa- 
sioned to others.

CONCLtTSION. 



Miss Pattt Montague, a fine 
young lady [to whom her noble 
uncle, at his death, devised the 
other moiety of his real and per- 
sonal estates, including his seat in 
Berkshire] lives at present with 
her excellent sister Mrs. Belford: 
to whom she removed upon Lord 
M/s death; but, in all probability, 
will soon be the lady of a worthy 
baronet, of ancient family, fine 
qualities, and ample fortunes, just 
returned firom his travels, with a 
character superior to theverygood 
one he set out with: a case that 
very seldom happens, although 
the end of travel is improvement. 

Colonel MoBDEN, who, with so 
many virtues and accomplish- 
ments cannot be unhappy, in 
several letters to the executor, 
with whom he corresponds firom 
Florence [having, since his un- 
happy affair witn Mr. Lovelace, 
changed his purpose of coming so 
soon to reside in England as he 
had intended] declares, tiiat al- 
though he thought himself obliged 
either to accept of what he took to 
be a challenge, as such: or tamely 
to acknowledge, that he gave up 
all resentment of his cousin s 



wrongs; and in a manner to beg 
pardon for having spokenfreelyof 
Mr. Lovelace behind his back; 
and although at the time he owns 
he was not sorry to becalledupon, 
as he was, to take either the one 
course or the other: yet now, 
cooUj reflecting upon his beloved 
cousm^s reasomngs against duel- 
ling; and upon the pric^ it had too 
probably cost the unhappy man; 
he wished he had more fuUy con- 
sidered those words in his cousin's 
postiiumous letter — "If God will 
allow him time for repentance, 
why should you deny it him?"* 

To conclude — The worthy 
widow Lovick continues to live 
with Mr. Belford; and by her pru- 
dent behaviour, piety, and useful- 
ness, has endeared herself to her 
lady, and the whole family. 



♦ Seyeral worthy persons have wished, 
that the heinous practice of duelling had 
been more forcibly discouraged, byway 
of note , at the conclusion of a work de- 
signed to recommend the highest and 
most important doctrines of Christianity; 
it is humbly presumed, that those per- 
sons have not sufficiently attended to 
what is already done on that subject in 
Vol. I. p. 254. and in Vol. IV. Letters

ways thonght , that sudden conver- 
sions, such especially , as were left 
to the candour of the reader to 
suppose and make out, had neither 
art nor nature nor even probability 
in them; and that they were more- 
over of very bad example. To 
have a Lovelace for a series of 
years glory in his wickedness, and 
think that he had nothing to do, 
but as an act of ^ace and favour 
to hold out his nand to receive 
that of the best of women, when- 
ever he- pleased, and to have it 
thought that marriage would be 
a sufficient amends for all his 
enormities to others as well as to 
her; he could not bear that. Nor 
is reformation as he has shewn in 
another piece*, to be secured by a 
fine face; by a passion that has 
sense for its object; nor by the 
goodness of a wife's heart, nor 
even example, if the heart of the 
husband be not graciously touched 
by the Divine finder. 

It will be seen, oy this time, that 
the author had a great end in 
view. He has lived to see scepti- 
cism and infidelity openly avowed, 
and even endeavoured to be 
propagated from the press: the 

freat doctrines of the gospel 
rought into question: those of 
self-denial and mortification blot- 
ted out of the catalogue of chris- 
tian virtues: and a taste even to 
wantonness for out-door pleasure 
and luxuiT, to the general ex- 
clusion of domestic as well as 
public virtue, industriously pro- 
moted amonff all ranks and de- 
grees of people. 

* Pamela. 



In this general depravity, when 

even the pulpit has lost great pait 

of its weight , and the clergy are 

considered as a body of interested 

men, the author thought he should 

be able to answer it to his oup 

heart, be the success what it 

, would, if he threw in his mite to- 

! wards introducing a reformatioii 

j so much wanted : and heimagiiMd, 

' that if an agje given up to diversion 

!and entertamment, he cou!^ steal 

■ in, as may be said, and investigate 

the great doctrines of Christianity 

under the fashionable ffoiseofan 

amusement, he shoula be moit 

likely to serve his purpose; re- 

membenng that of the poet: 

A verse may find him who a seimoii fli«*i 
And torn delight into a sacxifice. 

He was resolved therefore to 
attempt something that never yet 
had been done, fie considered 
that the tragic poets have as 
seldom made then: heroes true 
objects of pity, as the comic theirs 
laudable ones of imitation: and 
still more rarely have made them 
in their deaths look forward to a 
future hope. And thus , when they 
die they seem totally to perish. 
Death, in such instances, must ap- 
pear terrible. It must be con- 
sidered as the greatest eviL Bat 
why is death set in skoeking 
lights, when it is the universal 
lot? 

He has indeed thought fit to 
paint the death of the wicked as 
terrible as he could paint it. But 
he has endeavoured to draw that

end of a tragedy, than whea be

corrects the inuolence of human | 
nature, softens the mind of the 
beholder with sentiments of pity 
and compassion, comforts liim; 
under bis own private nfliiction, 
and teaches hioi not to judge of 
men's virtues by their Huccesaes*, 
1 cannot think of one real bero in 
all antic|uity so far raised above 
human inlirmities , that he might 
not be very naturally represented 
in a tragedy as plunged in mia- 
fortuuee and calamities. The poet 
may still find out some prevailing 
passion or indiscretion in his 
character, and slievr it in such a 
manner as will sufHcieatly acquit 
Providence of any injustice in his 
sufferings: for, as Horace ob- 
serves, tlie best man is faulty, 
though not in so great a degree 
as those whom we generally call 

"If such a strict poetical JMstke 
(proceeds the letter- writer) as 
some gentlemen insist upon, were 
to be observed in this art, there 
is no manner of reason why it

in the greatest point of glory and 
success, though his character is 
morally vicious, and only poeli- 
cat/tj good, if Imay use thepbrase 
of our modern critics. The JEneid 
is filled with innocent unhappy 

CBrsous. Nisus and Eurywus, 
ausus and Pallas, come all to 
unfortunate ends. The poet 
takes notice in particular, that^ in 
the sacking of Troy, Ei^heus fell, 
who was the most just man 
among the Trojans :

cannot see Hippolytus die oy the 
plot of his step-mother Phasdra, 
m Euripides, without compassion, 
because he died not, but for being 
chaste and virtuous." 

These are the great authorities 
BO favourable to the stories that 
end unhappily. And we beg leave 
to re-inforce this inference from 
them, that if the temporary suf- 
ferings of the virtuous and the 
good eau be accounted for and 
justified on Pagan principles, 
manymore,and inHnltely strouger 
reasons, will occur to a CtirisUan 
reader in behalf of what are called 
unhappy catastrophes, froln the

fiili're retcwdi; which is every

History of Clarissa. 

Ufthis(to give but one instance] 
an ingenious modern distinguish-

for his escellcut defence of some 
of the most important doctrines of 
Christianity, appears convinced

to amuse and divert, and not in

ought not to prescribe to the taste

at liberty to follow Dis own. He 
perhaps mistrusted his talents 1^

Begides nhat has been said 
above, and in the Preface, on this 
head, the following opinion of an 
ingenioaa and candid foreigner, 
on this manner of writing, may 
not be improperly inserted here. 

" The method which tbe author 
has pursued in the History of 
Clarissa, is the same as in the life 
of Pamela: both are related in 
familiar letters by the parties 
themselves, at the very time in 
which the events happened; and 
this method has given the author 
great advantages, which he conld 
not Lave drawn from any other 
species of narration. Tbe minate 
partieulara of events, tbe senti- 
ments and conversation of tbe 
EBTties, are, upon this plai 
ibited with all tbe warmth and 
spirit that the passion supposed 
to be predominant at the verv 
time could produce , and with all 
the distinguishing characteristics 
which memory can supply ii' " 
history of recent transactions. 

"Bomances in general, 
Marivaux's amongst others, 
whollyimprobable; because they 
suppose the history to be written 
after the series of events is closed 
by the catastrophe: a 
stance which implies a si

etters once written , the 
author has provided with great 
judgment, so as to render this cir-

it is presumed, that what this 
gentleman says of the difficulties 
attending a story thus given in 
the epistolary manner of writing, 
will not be found to reach tbe 
History before ns. It is very well 
accounted for in it, how the two 
principal female characters came 
to take BO ^eat a delight in writ- 
ing. Their subjects are not 
merely subjects of amusement;
